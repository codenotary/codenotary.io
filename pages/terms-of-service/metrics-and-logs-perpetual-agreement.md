  2. After the first twelve (12) month period of maintenance and support that is included in the base license, if Licensee wishes to obtain maintenance, Licensee shall pay an annual Support Fee. In the event that such Support Fee is not paid, CodeNotary shall have no obligation to provide maintenance for the Software for the period following the coverage of such Support Fee. The pricing during any such annual term shall be the same as that during the prior term unless CodeNotary has given Licensee written notice of a pricing increase at least thirty (30) days before the end of such prior term, in which case the pricing increase shall be effective upon renewal and thereafter.
