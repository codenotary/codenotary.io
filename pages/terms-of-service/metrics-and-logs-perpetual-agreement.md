## **CodeNotary License Agreement**

This CodeNotary License Agreement ("**CLA**"), is by and between
CodeNotary, Inc. ("**CodeNotary**") and you (either an individual or a
legal entity - the "**Licensee**"), as follows:

**WHEREAS** CodeNotary is the owner of CodeNotary Immutable Ledger
Metrics and Logs (**Performance Metrics)**, an application which
supports the VMware administration and operations team in order to
monitor and analyze VMware vSphere environments ("**Software**") which
CodeNotary markets directly and indirectly to end users; and

**WHEREAS** Licensee desires to utilize the Software, and CodeNotary
agrees to grant Licensee a limited license to use the Software on the
terms and conditions as set forth herein.

**NOW, THEREFORE,** in consideration of the mutual undertakings herein
contained, the parties hereby agree as follows:

1.  BY ENTERING INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH CODENOTARY THAT INCORPORATES
    THESE TERMS BY REFERENCE, OR USING THE SOFTWARE, LICENSEE
    ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREES TO BE BOUND
    BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS OR
    FUTURE MODIFICATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "TERMS").

2.  **Eligibility**. If Licensee is entering into this Agreement on
    behalf of an entity, organization, or company (a "Subscribing
    Organization"), Licensee represents and warrants that it has the
    authority to bind such Subscribing Organization and its Affiliates
    to these Terms and Licensee agrees to be bound by these Terms on
    behalf of such Subscribing Organization. In such case, "Licensee"
    in this Agreement means such Subscribing Organization, its
    Affiliates, and each end user of the Subscribing Organization. An
    "Affiliate" shall mean with respect to a Party, any entity which
    is controlled by such Party, which controls such Party, or which
    is under common control with such Party, where the term "control"
    means the ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty
    percent (50%) of the shares entitled to vote for the election of
    directors.

3.  **Free Trial**. If Licensee registers for a Free Trial on
    CodeNotary's website, CodeNotary will make all or part of the
    Software available to Licensee on a trial basis free of charge
    until the earlier of (a) the end of the Free Trial period for
    which Licensee registered, or (b) the date on which Licensee
    purchases a License hereunder. Additional terms and conditions may
    appear on the Free Trial registration web page within CodeNotary's
    website. Any such additional terms and conditions are incorporated
    into these CLAs by reference and are legally binding. ANY DATA OR
    CUSTOMIZATIONS ENTERED INTO THE SOFTWARE BY LICENSEE DURING THE
    FREE TRIAL PERIOD MAY BE PERMANENTLY LOST UNLESS LICENSEE
    PURCHASES A LICENSE FOR THE SOFTWARE OR EXPORTS SUCH DATA OR
    CUSTOMIZATIONS BEFORE THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD.
    NOTWITHSTANDING SECTION 11 (DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY), DURING THE
    FREE TRIAL PERIOD THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS" WITHOUT ANY
    WARRANTY.

4.  **Licensee Information**. Licensee shall provide CodeNotary, in
    manner instructed by CodeNotary, with information regarding
    Licensee and in particular information regarding user and password
    credentials ("**Licensee Information**"). Licensee hereby grants
    CodeNotary and CodeNotary hereby accepts a right to use Licensee
    Information in order to enable access of Licensee to the Software.
    CodeNotary shall not use Licensee Information for any other
    purpose. Licensee's provision of Licensee Information to
    CodeNotary is a prerequisite for use of the Software.

5.  **License**. Subject to the terms and conditions herein,
    CodeNotary hereby grants Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts, a
    personal, limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive, perpetual
    ("License") to use the software. The term "Software" may include,
    in CodeNotary's sole discretion services provided through use of
    the Software; revisions, corrections, modifications, enhancements,
    improvements and/or updates and upgrades thereof; and/or related
    documentation.

6.  **Reservation of Rights**. Subject to the limited rights
    expressly granted hereunder, CodeNotary reserves all rights, title
    and interest in and to the Software and all related intellectual
    property rights. No rights are granted to Licensee hereunder other
    than as expressly set forth herein. Furthemore, CodeNotary Inc
    also owns all rights to the following trademarks: a) Opvizor b)
    Performance Analyzer, c) Log Analyzer, d) Snapwatcher.

7.  **Restrictions**. Licensee must ensure that any permitted copy of
    the Software that it makes contains the same copyright and other
    proprietary notices that appear on or in the Software. Licensee
    shall not use the Software for any other purpose. Without
    derogating from the foregoing, Licensee shall not:

    a.  modify, merge or sub-license the Software;

    b.  sell, license (or sub-license), lease, assign, transfer, pledge,
        or share its rights under this License with/to anyone else;

    c.  create derivative works based on the Software or modify,
        disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, revise or enhance
        the Software or attempt to discover the Software's source
        code;

    d.  access the Software in order to

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.  build a competitive product or service, or

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. copy any features, functions, or graphics of the Software;

    e.  enable or allow others to use the Software using the Licensee
        Information;

    f.  circumvent technological measures intended to control access to
        the Software or to prevent certain uses of the Software or
        develop, distribute, or use with the Software, products that
        circumvent such technological measures.;

    g.  use the Software to share content or engage in behavior that:

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.  violates anyone's intellectual property right, including
            copyright, moral rights, trademark, trade dress, patent,
            trade secret, unfair competition, right of privacy, right
            of publicity, and any other proprietary rights
            ("Intellectual Property Rights") or

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, tortious,
            defamatory, libelous, vulgar, lewd, profane, invasive of
            another's privacy, or hateful; or

    h.  violate applicable law.

8.  **License Fee**. Licensee agrees to pay all fees specified herein
    or in an applicable purchase order. Except as otherwise specified
    herein or in a purchase order, (i) fees are quoted and payable in
    United States dollars (ii) payment obligations are non-cancelable
    and fees paid are non-refundable, and (vi) CodeNotary may change
    the Support Fees upon notice to Licensee as set forth below.

    a.  Licensee agrees to pay a one-time License Fee.

    b.  After the first twelve (12) month period of maintenance and
        support that is included in the base license, if Licensee
        wishes to obtain maintenance, Licensee shall pay an annual
        Support Fee. In the event that such Support Fee is not paid,
        CodeNotary shall have no obligation to provide maintenance for
        the Software for the period following the coverage of such
        Support Fee. The pricing during any such annual term shall be
        the same as that during the prior term unless CodeNotary has
        given Licensee written notice of a pricing increase at least
        thirty (30) days before the end of such prior term, in which
        case the pricing increase shall be effective upon renewal and
        thereafter. Any such pricing increase shall not exceed seven
        percent (7%) of the pricing for the relevant Support Fees in
        the immediately prior annual term, unless the pricing in such
        prior term was designated as promotional or one-time.

    c.  Additional features not originally included in Software are not
        covered unless the Licensee has paid the annual Support Fee.

    d.  CodeNotary will invoice Licensee for the License Fee and any
        Support Fees in advance and, unless otherwise stated in a
        purchase order, invoiced charges are due 30 days from the
        invoice date.

    e.  The Fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar
        governmental assessments of any nature, including but not
        limited to value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes,
        assessable by any local, state, provincial, federal or foreign
        jurisdiction (collectively, \"Taxes\"). Licensee is
        responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases
        hereunder. If CodeNotary has the legal obligation to pay or
        collect Taxes for which Licensee is responsible under this
        paragraph, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and
        paid by Licensee, unless Licensee provides CodeNotary with a
        valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate
        taxing authority. For clarity, CodeNotary is solely
        responsible for taxes assessable against it based on its
        income, property and employees.

9.  **Updates and Support**. Licensee hereby acknowledges and
    understands that:

    a.  The Software must be installed in a VMware vSphere environment.
        Software updates and support will be provided in the event that
        Licensee has paid the applicable Support Fees (or is still within the
        included first year of maintenance and support). Software updates will
        be provided online via the manual website **<https://manual.codenotary.com>.** Support will be provided via
        e-mail to **<support@codenotary.com>** or chat on www.codenotary.com.

    b.  The Software may require you to take certain steps to activate
        your Software. Failure to activate or register the Software, or a
        determination by CodeNotary of fraudulent or unauthorized use of the
        Software may result in reduced functionality or inoperability of the
        Software.

10. **Feedback**. CodeNotary shall have a royalty-free, worldwide,
    transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use
    or incorporate into the Software any suggestions, enhancement
    requests, recommendations or other feedback provided by Licensee,
    including Users, relating to the operation of the Software.
    CodeNotary is under no obligation to make any changes or
    modifications to the Software suggested by Licensee.

11. **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY**. THE SOFTWARE AND SUPPORT SERVICES ARE
    PROVIDED "AS-IS". TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
    CODENOTARY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
    NONINFRINGEMENT. CODENOTARY MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE
    WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS OR NEEDS OR THAT THE SOFTWARE
    WILL BE FREE FROM ERRORS, NOR DOES CODENOTARY MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS
    TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE
    OR THE ACCURACY OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE
    SOFTWARE OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED. The
    entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Software is
    borne by Licensee and Licensee shall be responsible for verifying
    any output resulting from use of the Software if Licensee intends
    to use or rely on such output. This disclaimer of warranty
    constitutes an essential part of this CLA. []{dir="rtl"}

12. **No Liability for Consequential or Related Damages**. Without
    derogating from the above, in no event shall CodeNotary or its
    distributors be liable for any indirect, special, incidental,
    consequential, cover or punitive damages (including, without
    limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business
    interruption, loss of business information, damages to campaign
    management, or other pecuniary loss), however caused, whether in
    contract, tort, or under any other theory of liability, arising
    out of the use of or inability to use the Software even if
    CodeNotary has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

13. **Limitation of Liability**. IN THE EVENT THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING
    THE TERMS OF THIS CLA, CODENOTARY IS FOUND LIABLE FOR DAMAGES
    BASED ON ANY DEFECT OR NONCONFORMITY OF ITS SOFTWARE, ITS TOTAL
    LIABILITY FOR ITS SOFTWARE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE LICENSE FEE PAID
    TO CODENOTARY FOR LICENSING SUCH DEFECTIVE SOFTWARE.

14. **Indemnification**. Licensee will indemnify CodeNotary and its
    subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, partners,
    and licensors from any claim, demand, loss, or damages, including
    reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to
    Licensee's use of the Software in violation of these terms.

15. **Term and Termination**. This CLA shall commence on the
    Effective Date and shall remain in effect perpetually unless
    otherwise terminated pursuant to this Section.

    a. **Termination by Licensee**. Licensee may stop using the
    Software at any time. Termination of your account does not relieve you
    of any obligation to pay any outstanding Fees. Upon termination or
    expiration of this CLA, the license granted herein shall be
    immediately terminated and Licensee shall cease using the Software and
    return to CodeNotary (or delete) any and all information related
    thereto. CodeNotary shall return to Licensee (or delete) all of
    Licensee Information.
    
    b. **Termination by CodeNotary**. If CodeNotary terminates these
    terms for reasons other than for cause, then CodeNotary will make
    reasonable effort to notify you at least 120 days prior to termination
    via the address provided to CodeNotary. All unearned maintenance and
    support fees at the termination date will be refunded based on the
    unexpired portion of the annual term. Unless otherwise stated herein,
    CodeNotary may at any time terminate these terms if:

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Licensee breaches any provision of these terms (or acts in a
              manner that clearly shows it does not intend to, or is unable to,
              comply with these terms);

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Licensee fails to make the timely payment of Fees for the
              Software or the Support Fees, if any;

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. CodeNotary is required to do so by law (for example, where the
              provision of the support services or Software to Licensee is, or
              becomes, unlawful); or

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. CodeNotary elects to discontinue the support services or
              Software, in whole or in part.

    c. **Survival**. Upon expiration or termination of these terms,
    any perpetual licenses Licensee has granted, Licensee's
    indemnification obligations, CodeNotary's warranty disclaimers or
    limitations of liabilities, and dispute resolution provisions stated
    in these terms will survive. Upon the expiration or termination of the
    Services, some or all of the Software may cease to operate without
    prior notice.

16. **Confidentiality**. The license to use the Software herein is
    granted on a confidential basis. All designs, engineering details,
    and other technical, financial, marketing, commercial and other
    information pertaining to the Software, this CLA and/or
    CodeNotary\'s business activities shall be considered
    "Confidential Information" of CodeNotary. Licensee agrees to use
    CodeNotary's Confidential Information only in connection with the
    license granted herein, to keep such Confidential Information
    confidential, and not to reproduce, copy, or disclose such
    Confidential Information to any third party, except with
    CodeNotary\'s prior written consent.

17. **Governing Law & Jurisdiction**. This CLA is governed only by
    the laws of the State of Texas, and shall have sole jurisdiction
    over any conflict or dispute arising out of, or in connection to,
    this CLA.

18. **Entire Agreement**. This CLA supersedes any previous terms and
    conditions and any other understandings, oral or written,
    including such terms pre-printed on any of Licensee's prior
    purchase orders. In any event of conflict between this CLA and any
    previous agreements or understandings, this CLA shall prevail.

19. **Manner of Giving Notice**. Except as otherwise specified
    herein, all notices, permissions and approvals shall be in writing
    and shall be deemed to have been given upon: (i) personal
    delivery, (ii) the second business day after mailing, (iii) the
    second business day after sending by confirmed facsimile, or (iv)
    the first business day after sending by email (provided email
    shall not be sufficient for notices of termination or an
    indemnifiable claim). Notices to Licensee shall be addressed to
    the registered email address of the Licensee. Notices to
    CodeNotary shall be addressed to: support\@CodeNotary.com.

20. **Waiver of Jury Trial**. Each party hereby waives any right to
    jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way
    arising out of or related to these CLAs.

21. **Injunctive Relief**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
    herein, in the event of Licensee or other's unauthorized access to
    or use of the Software in violation of these terms, Licensee
    agrees that CodeNotary is entitled to apply for injunctive
    remedies in addition to any other remedies available hereunder.

22. **Relationship of the Parties**. The parties are independent
    contractors. These CLAs do not create a partnership, franchise,
    joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship
    between the parties.

23. **Waiver and Cumulative Remedies**. No failure or delay by either
    party in exercising any right under these CLAs shall constitute a
    waiver of that right. Other than as expressly stated herein, the
    remedies provided herein are in addition to, and not exclusive of,
    any other remedies of a party at law or in equity.

24. **Severability**. If any provision of these CLAs is held by a
    court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the
    provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as
    best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the
    fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of
    these CLAs shall remain in effect.

25. **Assignment**. Licensee may not assign any of its rights or
    obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise,
    without the prior written consent of CodeNotary (not to be
    unreasonably withheld).

26. **Audit**. If Licensee is a business, company, or organization,
    then CodeNotary may, no more than once every 12 months, upon seven
    7 days' prior notice to Licensee, appoint an independent third
    party auditor who is obliged to maintain confidentiality to
    inspect Licensee's records, systems, and facilities to verify that
    Licensee's installation and use of any and all Software is in
    conformity with its valid licenses from CodeNotary. Additionally,
    Licensee will provide CodeNotary with all records and information
    requested by CodeNotary in order to verify that its installation
    and use of any and all Software is in conformity with Licensee's
    valid licenses from CodeNotary within 30 days of CodeNotary's
    request. If the verification discloses a shortfall in licenses for
    the Software, Licensee will immediately acquire any necessary
    licenses, subscriptions, and any applicable back maintenance and
    support. If the underpaid fees exceed 5% of the value of the
    payable license fees, then Licensee will also pay for CodeNotary's
    reasonable cost of conducting the verification.
