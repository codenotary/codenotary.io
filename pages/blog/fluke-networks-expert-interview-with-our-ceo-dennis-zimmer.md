> Infrastructure monitoring can be a tedious and time consuming chore. But if you're not careful, the rest of your to-do list can grow out of control if you focus too much on this task. Still, with just a little help, a big part of your day can be cleared up.

> That's what Dennis Zimmer, CEO of Opvizor Inc. says. I've seen so many avoidable issues and a lot of tuning possibilities that system administrators can't address due to a huge lack of time. Most administrators are jammed with work, so I decided to help them. That means you can have more time to focus on those other projects you need to get done.
