The guideline we started for Photon OS 3.0 Beta is still 100% valid. 

[Deploy the OVF template to run docker container and monitor the system using Performance Analyzer.](https://www.opvizor.com/photon-os-3-beta-first-steps-guide)

Project Photon OS™ is an open source, minimal Linux container host that is optimized for cloud-native applications, cloud platforms, and VMware infrastructure. Photon OS 2.0 includes new security features, OS management capabilities, and updated packages. We invite partners, customers, and community members to collaborate on using Photon OS to run high-performance virtual machines and containerized applications.

- **Optimized for VMware vSphere®**: The Linux kernel is tuned for performance when Photon OS runs on vSphere.
- **Support for containers**: Photon OS includes the Docker daemon and works with container orchestration frameworks, such as Mesos and Kubernetes.
- **Efficient lifecycle management**: Photon OS is easy to manage, patch, and update.
- **Security hardened**: The kernel and other aspects of the operating system are built with an emphasis on security.

There is also a [factsheet](https://vmware.github.io/photon/assets/files/photon-os-datasheet.pdf) available

The result will be a updated, running Photon OS, ready to run container and fully monitored.
