At [virtualizationsoftware.com](http://www.virtualizationsoftware.com/ "virtualizationsoftware.com") you can find a very special review of our Snapwatcher solution. It's not a pure product review it's an amazing read as it tells a story.

> The word “dangerous” is often used for hazardous chemicals or live ammunition so can vSphere snapshots really be dangerous or is that an exaggeration? The answer is that, for the health of your vSphere infrastructure, snapshots can absolutely be dangerous. Snapshots that are left unchecked and growing out of control can bring your entire vSphere infrastructure and all your critical applications to a halt. I’d say that’s dangerous! Dangerous for your company’s profits and future. Dangerous for your career growth.
