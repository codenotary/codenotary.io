Team Opvizor wants to take this opportunity to wish all of you a very **happy Easter**! 2015 starting amazing for use as we’ve seen a great increase in the number of users, and an amazing launch of our new tool [Snapwatcher](http://try.opvizor.com/snapwatcherent).

- We added dozens of new situations (rules) to [Health Analyzer](https://www.opvizor.com/register) to help you detect downtime and performance issues in your vSphere environment
- We’ve launched a brand new product [Snapwatcher](http://try.opvizor.com/snapwatcherent) to track, remediate and fix VM snapshots
- We started our amazing [DABCC promo](http://try.opvizor.com/dabcc)

Of course we want to share some of our customer feedback with you! Thanks a lot to all of our customers!

> Really like this tool as it's the only one I have found so far that discovered the broken and invalid snapshots in my environment. Always the newest tool version and functions thanks to the build-in autoupdate feature. Easy to use. In combination with opvizor, a great tool.

René Schärer, System Engineer, Hirslanden AG

> I've loved working with your product so very much. It's going to totally kill me when the trial is over. I'm not sure that I can go back to doing things the old way - not when there are such state-of-the-art tools within my grasp. Basically, you can have my Snapwatcher when you can pry it from my cold, dead, hard drive \*LOL\*

Miguel T. Velez-White, Sr. Prof. Systems Engineer, CSC

In the next few months, we have so much more exciting to coming up, so stay tuned and keep watching our news channel! Happy Easter, Happy Easter!!
