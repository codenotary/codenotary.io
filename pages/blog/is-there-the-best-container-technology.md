Container technology is creating a lot of buzz in the recent times. As people move from virtualization to container technology, many enterprises have adopted software container cloud application deployment. As this is a new technology, many big names in the IT industry and in the race of their standards and products more popularity than their competitors. Docker is a big name in this race. Docker software is very popular as it makes application deployment very easy and efficient. With Docker, a lot of work can be done in less time. This makes it one of the most interesting products in container technology.

Container technology is getting acceptance from many big IT companies. As the world of IT moves forward, this new concept is proving very useful in meeting the changing needs of application deployment. Hence, container technology is trending these days. Cashing in on this trend, many products have been introduced by software development companies. There is a stiff competition between various companies to push their technologies in the market. While choosing the right technology, it is essential to understand what each of them stands for and does. The requirement of the enterprises should also be taken into consideration.

## **Linux Containers**

With more products being launched, enterprises find it difficult to keep track of the products and choose the right one for their work. Linux is also going to play an important role in the proper execution of this technology. Known for its open source software, Linux containers have captured the attention of many users. Linux containers come with a lot of advantages. These are execution environment that has all the benefits included. With these containers, users can manage various parameters of the applications. These containers come with their own memory, network resources and so on. Hence, they are self reliant and reliable.

With Linux containers, users can get the benefit of using Linux system along with the host operating system. This container shares the kernel of the host operating system. However, it does not have the disadvantages of the host system like the weight and startup overhead. This makes the Linux container very useful for deployment.

As Linux makes it easy to customize the system according to the need of the application, such Linux containers are perfect for application deployment. Since cloud deployment has become very popular, there is a need for a technology that will simplify application deployment in the cloud. Linux containers are well suited for such deployments. Container technology is a better option than server virtualization. It gives better results and increases the performance of the application.

## **More About Linux And Linux Containers**

Linux containers inherit the benefits of the Linux kernel. The biggest advantage of the Linux kernel is namespaces. The Kernel creates a barrier between processes and containers. Linux packs resources together for every process so that it appears like a single process running independent of all other process. This separates process from one another. Hence, if a process gets hacked in some way, the entire container is not compromised. Other processes also do not become vulnerable due to this one process. This makes the container secure. A process or an application cannot be sure of other processes and applications running securely in a container. Hence, this separation is very necessary.

“Linux cgroups” is another main advantage of using Linux containers. With cgroups, system resources can be isolated. This isolation helps in making them available when required. It also helps in making the container secure. Resources like CPU cycles and memory are not used up by a single heavy process. This is the reason why various applications and their processes can be run with Linux containers.

Linux containers are commonly known as [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org). With such containers, many applications can run smoothly. Containers separate applications from the operating systems they are running on. With a container, users can run their applications on any operating system as long as the runtime environment is the same. 

This level of flexibility makes it easy for developers to run and deploy applications with ease. Hence, containers are used by many enterprises these days. LXC scores in many fields and gives unmatched performance. Linux containers are a way forward.

## **Docker**

Docker has been another name heard very often while talking about container technology. It started as a container application project. With its growth, many other things were achieved. Docker uses Linux containers that help in deploying applications across many platforms. It makes containers, portable and flexible. Hence, many industry big shots have shown support to Docker.

It continues to be one of the most suitable technologies for container applications. It packages the applications in such a way that they run effectively across various platforms and give best results. The packaging of the applications is the best thing about [Docker](http://www.docker.com).

With Docker, each container is run as a single process. Hence, you will need an equal number of containers as the processes running. This helps in securing the applications. The environment provided by Docker includes all the essential files. With such an environment, your applications run without any problem. With such applications, users will be very happy and satisfied.

Portability is the biggest advantage of Docker. As Docker strives to make your containers, portable, users can reuse these containers and get the best results from them. Hence, moving the container is not a problem with Docker. Apart from this, users can also With Docker; users can scale their applications when they want. Scalability has been an issue for many developers. 

Docker makes scalability possible with their architectural benefits. As Docker increase the efficiency of the applications, enterprises can see good results from their use. With this technology, Docker will get a lot of recognition in enterprises. As people move towards container technology, Docker is ready to offer a number of benefits. 

## Great view from the "outside"

There is also a great new article from one of my investors and famous Moshe Bar, about virtualization and container use cases. Instead of following the path of explaining things more and more complicated, he published a very clear analysis of todays technology: 

[Debunking Red Hat’s Assertions in ‘Containers Debunked’](http://www.atlantic.vc/debunking-red-hats-assertions-in-containers-debunked/)

> Nowadays, we are looking at Xen, KVM, VMware’s ESXi and a few other, more esoteric hypervisors on the virtualization side. Containers come with names such as LXC, openVZ, Virtuozzo, or Docker. Luckily most of the above are free (as in free beer or free speech) software, so we can try them all out, which people often do. However, this begs my original question: when should we use which technology, and for what purpose?

Containers will surely prove useful for developers of applications in the cloud. With Linux containers, developers can get a lot of work done in the best way possible. Overall, Docker is the way to go.
