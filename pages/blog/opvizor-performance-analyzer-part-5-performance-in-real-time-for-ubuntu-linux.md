Things to do after installing Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (XENIAL XERUS), please read the complete article [here](http://www.webupd8.org/2016/04/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-1604-lts-xenial-xerus.html).

[Here](https://itsfoss.com/speed-up-ubuntu-1310/) are 9 killer tips to speed up Ubuntu 14.04

The article was originally written for Ubuntu 13.10 but it is equally applicable for Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.04.

If you already installed Ubuntu 16.04.x LTS Xenial Xerus, [here](https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/first) is what's best for you to do, first of all.

It's a list of the things to do in three categories:

- the absolutely essential ones (part 1)
- the recommended ones (not essential, part 2)
- the neutral ones (possibly useful, part 3).

In normal Ext4 file system creation, default settings are used. These work well for default workloads. But if your server shows a non-average performance pattern, you may benefit from tuning the performance of the Ext4 file system. In this [article](http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/tip/Tuning-the-Ext4-file-system-for-optimal-performance), see how to push Ext4 to the max.

## The New Way

If you’re looking for a very modern way to check and monitor performance, you should give [**Performance Analyzer a try**](http://try.opvizor.com/perfanalyzer/). 

Monitor and Analyze Ubuntu Linux configuration and performance metrics. Correlate events and metrics from applications and OS inside the guest with our Ubuntu OS metrics. If running virtual, combine them with VMware vSphere or OpenStack metrics. Troubleshoot issues using our efficient data crawler and preconfigured dashboards.

Some of our Ubuntu OS integration features are:

- Get System overall status (across multiple systems)
- Find Disk I/O bottlenecks
- Full insights into Disk Latency and VM Disk IOps
- See Memory Issues and Network Issues (Packet Loss) instantly
- Get all networking details
- Combine with applications running on top of the OS
