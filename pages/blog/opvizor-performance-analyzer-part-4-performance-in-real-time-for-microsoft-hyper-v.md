"In Windows management, _best practices_ are guidelines that are considered the ideal way, under normal circumstances, to configure a server as defined by experts. Best practice violations, even critical ones, might not necessarily cause problems. But, they can indicate server configurations that can result in poor performance, poor reliability, unexpected conflicts, increased security risks, or other potential problems.The Best Practices Analyzer scans your computer using rules based on these best practices and reports the results. Each best practice rule includes details about how to comply with the rule. This section documents these rules to help you understand the best practices that apply to Hyper-V, as well interpret results when a scan finds conditions that don't comply with best practices."Says Kathy Davies from Microsoft, read the complete article [here](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server-docs/compute/hyper-v/best-practices-analyzer/best-practices-analyzer-for-hyper-v).

There is a [checklist](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd722835(v=bts.10).aspx) available from Microsoft for Optimizing Performance on Hyper-V.

[Here](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd744830.aspx) are six best practices from Microsoft for physical servers hosting the Hyper-V role.

"Many things have changed in the way we use technology since Windows 7 was released. The key trigger for these changes is the end-users — an office worker, an IT admin, the mobile workforce or someone from management who needs to always be connected, from anywhere with any kind of device. Windows 10 was built around the end-user's needs and it offers more personal interactions on a variety of devices — PCs, smartphones, tablets or even Xbox One. Windows 10 Enterprise brings more to device management and security through the new features and enables organizations to have better control of their mobile and interconnected workforce.From an end-user’s perspective, Windows 10 is a converged platform, which has the same look and feel on any device — a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop or a desktop. From a developer’s perspective, we can also talk about Windows 10 as the universal platform. If you develop an application for Windows 10 desktop edition, the same application can be used for the Windows 10 tablet edition or the mobile edition, with no redevelopment needed."Says Cristian-Antonio Puricica, read the complete article [here](https://hyperv.veeam.com/blog/whats-windows-10-bringing-to-the-enterprise/).
