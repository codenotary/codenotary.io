## 81% of VMware vSphere environments are losing precious disk space to broken or invalid snapshots.

  We want to change that.

About 4 weeks ago we launched our beta version of Snapwatcher to help alleviate virtual machine administrators from having to constantly hunt and firefight broken snapshots to preserve disk space. Snapwatcher is the first automated solution that constantly monitors all snapshots across the whole VMware vCenter system to detect and fix any old, broken or invalid snapshots. It comes with a powerful but simple dashboard where you can manage hundreds of snapshots in one place. Whenever Snapwatcher removes or repairs a **broken snapshot**, you’ll get a progress report to see how much memory you’re saving.

We had seen from our own experience and our customers’ that **broken snapshots** were a huge pain point, but we’re very pleased with the reception of our beta launch. In less than 2 weeks we had over 700 beta testers download the free version of Snapwatcher.

Our beta users gave us great feedback and insights, and helped us discover a few more scenarios which cause broken snapshots to occur. We’ve since added additional workflows to repair these specific types of broken snapshots, and now Snapwatcher can now detect all types of normal and bad snapshots and fix 95 out of 100 broken snapshots. Our beta testers also request that Snapwatcher be able to ignore certain VMs and their snapshots. These features will be available in the paid version of Snapwatcher.

We’re excited to announce that we’re launching a commercial version of Snapwatcher 2.0 on March 24th for only $499 per user. Snapwatcher 2.0 will track and log snapshot deletion and repair tasks executed over time, giving users a history of all their snapshots and remediation activities. Snapwatcher 2.0 also offers enhanced fixing of inconsistent or broken snapshots, detection of running backups, and more.

We’re still continuing to offer a free edition of Snapwatcher with some new improvements, but it will be limited to read-only functions like snapshot detection and size reporting.

You can find and purchase the commercial version of Snapwatcher at [http://try.opvizor.com/snapwatcherent](http://try.opvizor.com/snapwatcherent).
