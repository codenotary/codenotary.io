An interesting article about VMware Hot-Add RAM from [Vladan SEGET](https://www.vladan.fr/author/vladan/):

VMware Hot-Add RAM feature isn’t new, but somehow we haven’t covered it much just yet. So this post will explain What is VMware Hot-Add RAM and How to use it. The Hot-Add RAM goes hand in hand with Hot-Add CPU, but we’ll cover that in a separate post.
