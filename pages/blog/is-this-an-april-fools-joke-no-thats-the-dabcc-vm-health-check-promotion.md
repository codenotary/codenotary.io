We thought long and hard about our April fool this year, but we came up with something totally different. Instead of an hoax, we´ll do a promotion of our opvizor Health Analyzer enterprise edition.

What is the promotion all about? We had a podcast the day before and came up with the idea of doing something special for smaller environments to be still protected, although the budget is tight.

- max. 10 VMware ESX/ESXi Hosts within 1 vCenter
