Data centers are undergoing big changes in order to accommodate huge chunks of data in industries. As this data is very important, it is vital to provide good solutions to store it. Physical data centers are being replaced by virtual machines. The concept of virtualization has become very important over the years. With new technologies emerging in this field, it is interesting to see how data is handled by IT companies.The next very important point is to secure the data. Data security is a challenging problem in the virtual world. You must find the best options to secure your data. As data is scattered through many virtualization, you must be assured that the data is fully protected. It is always better to choose security while making virtualization itself.

## VMware

[VMware](http://www.vmware.com/products.html) is the pioneer in the field of virtualization. Over the years, VMware has given many world class products that have changed the face of data centers. Virtualization offers amazing ways of data storage without the excessive use of actual devices. As it is not possible to have physical devices for greater data storage. With virtualization, companies can get the environment of their choice for storing data. It is easy to implement virtualization for this purpose.

_The face of data centers has changed over the last years._

## Vsphere And Other Concepts

In the recent times, there have been many changes in the field of virtualization. Companies have adopted these changes as they give better results. vSphere is one such amazing technology that offers server virtualization. With this technology, people can give amazing server solutions. One can get virtual servers that have just the right environment as one prefers. This is a very powerful tool that offers excellent servers without actually using physical devices as servers. [vSphere](http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html) is very useful, fast and efficient. vSphere is also perfect for your cloud. As cloud computing becomes more acceptable in the field of IT, there was a need for a server virtualization that goes well with this concept. vSphere is the answer to all the cloud related services. There have been new technologies in the recent times that have helped the widespread of cloud computing. Container technology is also very helpful in providing excellent data storage at low costs.

## Micro-Segmentation

To apply micro segmentation on your network you must have virtual machines in your organization. You must have local routers for your virtual machines to get connected. After connecting your virtual machines validating your connection is an important task. Once you validate your network connection on your virtual machine you must enable the NSX security on your machine. NSX security works to the maximum on micro segmentation only. Micro segmentation helps provides the best platform for virtual networking. It makes you ease in working without any tension about security.Though you may find all kinds of security alerts nowadays, it is not possible to ensure your security on virtual machines. Virtual machines need special attention as there is a large integration of data on network virtualization. NSX runs parallel on the network and finds the best way to protect the infrastructure of your virtual machine. You may create firewalls physically on hardware, but there are high costs and it will not get you the maximum benefit you expect. There comes the need for micro segmentation. Micro segmentation allows you to create a firewall for data that travels from one data center to another. This will enable you to find enemies attacking from laterally.

## Micro-Segmentation Benefits

Micro-segmentation is a concept that is getting a lot of attention. It offers good network virtualization that is very useful for proper utilization of the resources. With micro-segmentation, IT companies can get a secure and efficient network. Various devices can access this data at a speedy rate. With micro-segmentation, vSphere can be used without any security concern. This task is done effectively by [NSX](http://www.vmware.com/products/nsx.html). With NSX, companies can use vSphere without any security hassles. Since many people use cloud storage for all sorts of data storage, there is a risk of hackers attacking the clouds and getting sensitive data. With NSX, vSphere can be made secure and reliable. NSX offers micro-segmentation that makes vSphere very safe to use.

## [More](http://www.vmware.com/products/nsx.html) From NSX

As NSX becomes popular, people are adopting it in their data center. VMware is set to bring more features to NSX in the coming years. With proper implementation of this concept, the data centers will see a lot of difference in the way the network functions in big companies. The NSX is truly worth trying for all. It has been accepted by many key players in the IT world.

## Advantages Of NSX Security In Virtualization

Once your data or operating systems or your server is being virtualized, you can be tension free only if your virtual machines are secure. NSX security does not require any further changes in the working schedules and workloads. It helps to establish more virtual networks without any hesitation. NSX security is the least cost effective security available in the market. It can be applied in kind of application. In cloud management, NSX provides the best platform to work with full support on part of integration of data from any network. So just provide security in your virtual machine to enable the best output from virtualization.
