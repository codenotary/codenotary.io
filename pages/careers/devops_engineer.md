If you’re crazy about DevOps, Blockchain, and latest technology, this might be the perfect fit for you.

We are looking for smart, dedicated, and experienced software engineers to join CodeNotary and help us develop and iteratively improve our software delivery process, as well as run and maintain our infrastructure services (Applications, Blockchain, Postgres).

CodeNotary is the Open Source leader for immutable trust solutions such as [immudb](http://www.immudb.io/) and [CodeNotary](http://www.codenotary.io/).

We process tens of millions of transactions every month and are growing fast to new markets and use cases.

If you are hard-working and used to fast-paced environments, with a passion for applying technology to solve business problems, you’ll feel like home. That said, you will be surrounded by experienced gophers that are keen to work with you.

- 5+ years of experience in managing Linux based infrastructure
- 5+ years of hands-on experience at least in one scripting language
- Experience with Docker + Kubernetes/OpenShift
