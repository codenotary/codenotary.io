If you have ever developed a database or key/value store, if you know Linux inside out, and if you are a Go wizard, then we need to talk.
We are looking for smart, dedicated and experienced Back-End engineers to join CodeNotary. Most of the code is written in Go, so if you write exemplary code and know Golang inside out, you’ll feel like home. That said, you will be surrounded by experienced gophers that are keen to work with you.
