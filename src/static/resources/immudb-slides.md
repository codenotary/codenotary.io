 immudb is a database with built-in cryptographic inclusion proof and verification

* immudb tracks changes of your data 

* the integrity of the history is protected by clients
* the client does not need to trust the server

* immudb operates as a key-value store or as relational database (SQL).
```

```
‚û°Ô∏è   As such immudb is a tamper-evident database with built-in crypto verification

---

* Traditional database transactions and logs are hard to scale and are mutable
* there is no way to know for sure if your data has been compromised.
* immudb is immutable, ie. you can add new versions of existing records

‚òùüèº  but never change or delete record‚òùüèº
```

```

‚û°Ô∏è   this lets you store critical data without fear of it being changed silently.


---

Is it a blockchain or a database?

* Data stored in immudb is cryptographically coherent and verifiable, just like blockchains
* but without all the complexity
* Unlike blockchains, immudb can handle millions of transactions per second
* immudb can be used both as a lightweight service or embedded in your application as a library.
* immudb runs everywhere, on an IoT device,  on-premises or cloud-based.

```

```
‚û°Ô∏è   immudb is already used by hundreds of projects to store data in a tamper-proof way 

---
Typical use cases


* secure and tamper-evident log data
* sensor data
* business transactionsi
* software build recipes
* rule-base data
* credit card transaction ledgers
* Storing last known positions of submarines
* etc. etc. 

```

Getting immudb running

Download the immudb binary from:
 [the latest releases on Github](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases/latest) 

After downloding, rename it to `immudb`, make sure to mark it as executable, then run it.

 The following example shows how to obtain v1.0.0 for linux amd64:

```bash
wget https://github.com/vchain-us/immudb/releases/download/v1.0.0/immudb-v1.0.0-linux-amd64
mv immudb-v1.0.0-linux-amd64 immudb
chmod +x immudb

# run immudb in the foreground to see all output
./immudb

# or run immudb in the background
./immudb -d
```

Alternatively, you may use Docker to run immudb in a ready-to-use container:

```bash
docker run -d --net host -it --rm --name immudb codenotary/immudb:latest
```

If you are running the Docker image without host networking, make sure to expose ports 3322 and 9497.

mv immuclient-v1.0.0-linux-amd64 immuclient
chmod +x immuclient

# start the interactive shell
./immuclient

# or use commands directly
./immuclient help
```

---

Or use docker üíÅüèΩ


Alternatively, you may use Docker to run immuclient in a ready-to-use container:

Is it fast?

immudb can handle millions of writes per second üõ©Ô∏è

Here wwe measuree inserting 1M entries on a 4-core E3-1275v6 CPU and SSD disk:


| Entries | Workers | Batch | Batches | time (s) | Entries/s |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1M | 20 | 1000 | 50 | 1.061 |   1.2M /s |
| 1M  | 50  | 1000 |  20 | 0.543  | 1.8M /s |
| 1M |  100 | 1000 |  10 | 0.615 |  1.6M /s |

[It's also extremely reliable. Some immudb users run billions of transactions every month !](!)
