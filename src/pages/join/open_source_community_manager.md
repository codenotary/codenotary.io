Our software solution can be used on-premise or in the cloud, is always easy to use and can process millions of transactions a second with cryptographic verification of no-tampering. The core engine of CodeNotary Immutable Ledger® is open-source [immudb](https://codenotary.com/technologies/immudb/), the world’s fastest immutable database.
