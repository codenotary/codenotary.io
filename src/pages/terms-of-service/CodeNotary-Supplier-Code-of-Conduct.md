# **Supplier Code of Conduct**

## **Introduction**

CodeNotary is committed to the highest standards of ethical and legal conduct and responsibility, and to ensure its principles throughout all of its operations, including its supply chain. We expect all CodeNotary suppliers to conduct themselves ethically and with integrity and to understand and comply with this Supplier Code of Conduct, in addition to their obligations under their contracts with CodeNotary and to all applicable laws and regulations and any other obligations they may have.  We also expect our suppliers to use their best efforts to cascade these principles through their own supply chain and implement them with their suppliers and subcontractors.

## **Law and Regulatory Compliance**

CodeNotary suppliers are expected to know and operate in full compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to them, including but not limited to laws and regulations concerning anti-corruption and bribery, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, prevention of slavery and human trafficking, data privacy and security, trade and export control, competition, the environment, dealings with government, labor and employment, and trading in securities.  CodeNotary suppliers supporting CodeNotary's U.S. government contracts or subcontracts must follow all applicable Federal Acquisition Regulations (FARs).

## **Information Protection**

CodeNotary suppliers shall properly handle sensitive information, including confidential, proprietary, and personal information, including trade secrets and company financial information. Information provided by CodeNotary should be used only as allowed in the supplier's contracts with CodeNotary.

Suppliers must protect the confidential, proprietary, and personal information of others from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, and disclosure, through appropriate physical and electronic security procedures. Suppliers must comply with applicable data privacy laws.

CodeNotary suppliers must comply with the intellectual property rights of CodeNotary and third parties and all the applicable laws governing intellectual property rights assertions, including protection against disclosure, patents, copyrights, and trademarks.

## **Conflict of Interest**

CodeNotary suppliers are expected to avoid all conflicts of interest or situations giving the appearance of a potential conflict of interest. Suppliers are expected to provide notification to all affected parties in the event that an actual or potential conflict of interest arises. This includes a conflict between the interests of CodeNotary and personal interests or those of close relatives, friends, or associates.

## **Insider Trading, Corruption, and Money Laundering**

CodeNotary suppliers and their personnel must not use any material or non-publicly disclosed information obtained in the course of their business relationship with CodeNotary as the basis for trading or for enabling others to trade in the stock or securities of any company.

CodeNotary suppliers or potential suppliers must strictly comply with all rules and regulations on bribery and corruption, and avoid unacceptable business practices, and are expected to exert reasonable due diligence to prevent and detect such practices in all business arrangements, including partnerships, joint ventures, offset agreements, and the hiring of intermediaries such as agents or consultants. CodeNotary suppliers shall not, directly or indirectly, offer to any CodeNotary Staff money, goods, or services as a consideration or in expectation of a favorable decision, information, opinion, recommendation, vote or any other form of favorism which qualifies as a corruption.

CodeNotary suppliers shall take all measures to prevent money laundering within their sphere of influence.

## **Human Rights and Employment Practices**

CodeNotary does not tolerate child labor, slavery, human trafficking, servitude, or forced or compulsory labor in its supply chain and CodeNotary suppliers must adhere to the same standards in their own supply chains.  

We are committed to providing a safe workplace, free of harassment, and equal opportunity in all our employment practices to all qualified employees, contractors, and applicants without regard to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital status, military status, or any other category protected by federal, state, and local laws.  

We expect our suppliers to protect the human rights of their employees and to treat their employees fairly, with dignity and respect.  We expect our suppliers to share our commitment to equal opportunity, diversity, and inclusion, and providing a safe workplace. CodeNotary suppliers shall prohibit harassment, including but not limited to physical, verbal, psychological, and sexual harassment, or other abusive conduct.  CodeNotary suppliers shall conduct their employment practices in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and consistent with International Labor Organization standards, including those concerning working hours, wages and benefits, and freedom of association.

## **Financial Responsibility**

CodeNotary suppliers are expected to create and maintain accurate books and records and make available for audit and inspection all documents related to the products and services they provide to CodeNotary. CodeNotary suppliers must not alter any record entry to conceal or misrepresent the underlying transaction represented by it. They are expected to ensure bills are accurate and properly submitted in a timely manner, and that any expenses incurred are properly documented, reasonable, and necessary. They must also securely retain and destroy documents in accordance with applicable law, regulations, and standards.

## **Environment, Health, and Safety**

We expect CodeNotary suppliers to adopt policies and practices to reduce environmental impact, and to protect the health, safety, and the welfare of their employees, contractors, visitors, and others who may be affected by their activities. Suppliers shall follow all applicable environmental, health and workplace laws, regulations, and standards.

## **Compliance and Reporting**

CodeNotary suppliers are expected to monitor their compliance with this Supplier Code of Conduct and ensure their employees, agents, and subcontractors understand and comply with this Supplier Code of Conduct. CodeNotary suppliers must promptly inform CodeNotary of any noncompliance or suspected violation of this Supplier Code and CodeNotary reserves the right to audit suppliers' compliance. 

We will not retaliate against, or tolerate retaliation by any other person against, anyone who in good faith reports a violation or suspected violation of this Supplier Code of Conduct.
