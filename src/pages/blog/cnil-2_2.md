HOUSTON, May 17th, 2021 -- CodeNotary ( [www.codenotary.com](https://www.codenotary.com) ), the immutability specialist that provides end-to-end tamper proof protection for software development and workloads, has released version 2.2 of its flagship product CodeNotary Immutable Ledger (CNIL). CNIL is available cloud based or self-hosted to deploy and run anywhere.

This release is an important step for our customers and anyone who wants to protect from supply chain attacks and requires a modern and fine-grained artifact and software signature solution with powerful revocation capabilities. In the light of the latest supply chain attacks that affected SolarWinds, Codecov, Rapid7, HashiCorp and many others, weâ€™re absolutely thrilled to provide powerful DevSecOps products.

CodeNotary Immutable Ledger 2.2 incorporates new features targeted at protecting CI/CD pipelines:

* VCN command line tool integrates with CI/CD pipelines, including an automatic collection of the whole pipeline environment for better artifact search
* Arbitrary files, eg. security scanner reports, can be attached (immutable) to the notarized artifact
* GitHub actions for notarization and authentication are available for automatic artifact and Git repository processing based on PRs or releases
* Identities (API keys) can be rotated and revoked programmatically
* VCN takes into account revoked keys when authenticating assets 
* User interface improvements, especially in the CI/CD pipeline and artifact query view
* Multi-ledger query API keys to find artifacts across separated teams

The [cloud version](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup) can be accessed immediately and a self-hosted trial can be downloaded from [CodeNotary website](https://www.codenotary.com).
