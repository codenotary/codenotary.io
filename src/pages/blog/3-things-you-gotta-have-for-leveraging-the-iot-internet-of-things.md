Just like cloud computing and big data, the Internet of Things (or IoT) has ceased being just a cool buzzword to toss around, and has become a factor that developers have to deal with. The IoT manifested first in the industrial world with machine sensors, instruments in engines, etc. Only recently has it taken off in the consumer sector, but now the IoT is ruled by smartphone apps, smart watches, connected fitness and health devices, and even pet monitoring solutions. Indeed, the IoT is here.

Yet the IoT is nothing without apps. That means that [developers are the backbone of the IoT](http://www.cio.com/article/2843814/developer/how-to-develop-applications-for-the-internet-of-things.html "developers are the backbone of the IoT"). Fortunately, VMware is on board with the whole concept and offers plenty of solutions for building the infrastructure necessary to leverage the IoT, helping developers manage the tremendous influx of devices that the IoT brings, and even collecting, storing, processing, using, all that data and keeping it secure.

## 1\. VMware AirWatch and vRealize Operations (vROps)

It's time for developers to get plugged in to the IoT. VMware offers a host of solutions to help you develop better apps for the IoT, deploy those apps, and manage the data those apps generate.

One of the greatest challenges from the development end of the IoT is the issue of managing thousands or millions of connected things all at once. VMware has made it easier by giving developers the ability to [manage all the connected devices as a single thing](https://www.vmware.com/ciovantage/article/3-essentials-for-your-iot-toolkit "manage all the connected devices as a single thing") using VMware AirWatch and vRealize Operations (vROps).

VMware honed this technology for the industrial sector, which used it even before consumers hopped on the IoT for things like managing vehicle fleets and widely distributed connected vending machines. Now, developers can leverage the same technology for managing smartphones and other consumer-grade connected devices, like the Apple Watch, Fitbit, etc.

## 2\. VMware Log Insight

When a user uses or interacts with an IoT connected device, the IoT Gateway sends the data generated or collected back to the data center. With modern analytical capabilities, this data no longer has to be stored until someone has the time to go through, analyze it, and make decisions on it. Using [AirWatch with vROps and VMware Log Insight](https://blogs.vmware.com/management/2015/06/3-reasons-integrate-log-insight-vrealize-operations.html "AirWatch with vROps and VMware Log Insight"), developers can have the data scanned at the gateway. The data can then be analyzed to identify patterns and respond with a suitable action based on those patterns.

Industrial applications for this monitoring, analysis, and automatic response include the ability to send an alert to a supervisor if equipment overheats. Consumer applications include sending a notification to a patient or health care provider (or both) if a patient's vital signs stray outside safe or normal ranges, such as when their blood sugar skyrockets or their heart rate becomes erratic.

## 3\. VMware vCloud Air Public Cloud

The hybrid cloud makes it far simpler and easier to manage the huge influx of devices that the IoT brings.

Another issue developers will have to address to leverage the IoT is the deployment of all their applications. This is where the vCloud Air public cloud comes in. A unified hybrid cloud gives the developer the flexibility to deploy and run IoT applications securely while keeping things simple and easy to manage. Without the hybrid cloud, developers could easily become overwhelmed with the complexity of the IoT.
