Before you get too wrapped up in unwrapping gifts and wrapping up year-end reports, it's time to take a peek into next year. What does 2016 have in store? What will the biggest trends in [virtualization](http://vmblog.com/archive/2013/07/24/cloud-computing-virtualization-market-to-2016-industry-trends-size-share-growth-analysis-and-forecast-research-report.aspx#.VlnmNHarRmN) and VMware be? Here's a preview of what's to come. 

## **1\. Virtual Desktops Finally Take Off**

_Microsoft still leads the way in virtual desktop experiences, but will quickly be followed up with a Linux option. Look for virtual desktops to dominate in 2016._

Microsoft made huge strides in promoting the concept of virtual desktops with their (more or less) successful roll out of Windows 10. Linux isn't far behind. [dinCloud](https://www.dincloud.com/ "dinCloud"), which is one of the leaders in offering virtual desktops as a service, is already offering Linux virtual desktops in beta version. Expect that virtualization will be a real trend in 2016. 

## **2\. Containers Become a Driving Force for Providing SaaS Services** 

The SaaS model is taking off, and containers have proven to offer an easier and more reliable way to package and deliver applications to different IT environments. Containers make onsite hosting simple and offer a cheaper way of delivering SaaS services. In an age where vendors are competing viciously for customers, the cost savings offered by containers will make it possible to drive down prices and attract more customers. 

## **3\. Security Migrates from the Network Perimeter to the Endpoints** 

As it turns out, 2015 was no better in terms of data breaches than 2014. This has forced most IT and cyber security experts to rethink how modern security is being done. Expect 2016 to witness a migration from perimeter security (which is quite obviously, not working) [towards endpoint security](http://vmblog.com/archive/2015/10/07/dincloud-2016-predictions-current-it-trends-and-2016-projections.aspx#.Vlnl_HarRmN). Security monitoring and software will focus on the devices and end users accessing the network instead of the network itself. Look for new products and services to spring up offering this new type of security. Also, expect security systems to be multi-layered. No single layer of protection is sufficient in this era. 

## **4\. A New Era of Backups**

_Backup and disaster recovery products will no longer be structured so that businesses have to lose 24 hours to restore. The products of tomorrow will allow them to restore systems to any point in time before an event occurred to corrupt or destroy the data._

To date, backup products have been designed to restore systems back to the last point in time at which they were backed up. This isn't working anymore. With modern threats like ransomware, businesses just cannot afford to lose a day's worth of data by restoring to yesterday's backups. Look for more cloud backup vendors to offer [Continuous Data Protection](http://www.computerweekly.com/Continuous-data-protection-CDP-explained-True-CDP-vs-near-CDP) (or CDP). This method of backing up and restoring systems allows the systems administrator (or other IT professional) to restore the systems to the exact point in time when an intrusion or other data corruption occurred.Did you expect to see better VMware monitoring in the 2016 forecast?
