If you are in IT, chances are you've at least heard about the recent VMware 2015 convention which took place in San Francisco at the Moscone Center from August 30-September 3. The convention has outgrown the typical, "Let's see what all the cloud vendors are up to this year," and has become THE place to announce and/or learn about all things cloud, and indeed, all things relating to data center infrastructure. If you're in Europe, it's not too late to participate in [VMworld 2015](http://www.vmware.com/radius/vmworld-2015-the-end-of-the-beginning-lets-go/ "VMworld 2015"). Those on the right side of the Pond can catch it in Barcelona from October 12-15 at the Fira Barcelona Gran Via.

## VMworld 2015: A Recap

_VMworld has become more than just a vendor's show. It's now the best place to meet and engage with the industry leaders in data center infrastructure._

Day one of VMworld 2015 was primarily focused on data center infrastructure. Day two focused mostly on the clients, including management issues, applications, and security issues. The traditional talk by CEO Pat Gelsinger was moved to a more prominent place in the program. Gelsinger spoke about the current motto and theme of VMware, One Cloud, Any App, Any Device." Gelsinger also illustrated the challenges put forth on today's cloud service providers, stating that they have to figure out how to, "innovate like a startup and deliver like an enterprise."

The most prominent theme of this year's event was the [hybrid cloud](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtmarko/2015/09/09/vmworld-2015-postmortem/ "hybrid cloud"). Specifically, VMware is touting the hybrid cloud that spans a number of separate public and private clouds. In this hybrid cloud, workloads shift automatically across cloud environments, depending on the demand for and availability of the resources. One industry term for this is 'cloudbursting'. The latest version of VMotion provides this capability.

In reality, not many businesses are actually doing this. Nevertheless, VMware wants users to know it's available, and really, really want them to start doing it even if they don't want to.

VMworld 2015 also crowned the first ever [VMworld Hackathon winner](https://blogs.vmware.com/vmworld/2015/09/wrapping-up-vmworld-2015-day-4-recap.html "VMworld Hackathon winner"). This event drew lots of attention and media coverage. The event was geared toward developers and lasted all day.

Much of VMworld was also the typical "meet the vendors" atmosphere, though many of the industry's movers and shakers chose to remain unregistered and spend their time meeting with colleagues, chatting it up with customers, and getting their heads together with industry analysts.
