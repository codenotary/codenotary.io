We received a request for a Performance Analyzer heatmap dashboard that allows drilldown showing critical virtual machine highlights. Thanks to our highly flexible platform that is build on [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), we could prepare the dashboard within an hour and the customer had it up and running the next minute.

That´s not it - when we prepare a dashboard for one customer, every customer of us can use the dashboard as well. Therefore, you can download the heatmap dashboard in our Change Log / Patch section of our online manual.

Just download Performance Analyzer and give it a try and check [http://manual.opvizor.com](http://manual.opvizor.com) (Change Log/ Patch) to get the new Virtual Machine Performance Heatmap dashboard.

We always listen to customer feedback - therefore, if you have any ideas or comments, please let us know. Maybe your dashboard idea is next.
