## VMware Support News, Alerts, and Announcements

Today we are pleased to announce the beta launch of the docs.vmware.com site. This portal unifies the product documentation for all products, versions, and languages into a single site so you can find the information that you are looking for more quickly. VMware products offer a wide range of business solutions from desktop virtualization to support your hybrid cloud. We’ve heard your feedback that finding the right information can be difficult. Our search was out of date, the look and feel was not modern, the content was siloed, and the docs were not available on mobile devices. To address these problems, we decided to create a new site from scratch. The design of this site is meant to enable you to better filter content, find relevant answers, and create custom views of information that you can access on any device.

## Key Features for You

Here are a few features that we hope will help you find the information that you need.

**It’s All About Search**

Our site design features search on every page. We’ve put in a new Elastic Search engine and a taxonomy to help you more easily locate relevant content. You can search the entire site or a particular book.

**Filter to Find What You Need**

With tens of thousands of pages of information, you need help reducing the scope of content to the products that you care about. Use the filters to limit your search to particular products, versions, or information types.

**Create Customer Collections and Share Content**

Use the MyLibrary feature to assemble custom doc sets that you can share as HTML collections.

**Your Feedback**

Let us know if you want to get involved in helping us evolve our docs. Expect to hear more about the docs.vmware.com site as we prepare for the official launch.

The beta launch of this site is only Step 1. We’ve put in new feedback mechanisms so we can hear from you more often and make more frequent improvements to the site and content.
