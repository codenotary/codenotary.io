NetApp released its latest ONTAP version 9 some months ago and more and more customers are upgrading to that version. We´re very happy to announce that we officially support NetApp ONTAP 9 since today. All data collection components and Dashboards have been updated to the latest version and are fully integrated now.

The combination of Performance Analyzer´s capabilities to collect data from VMware vSphere, Microsoft Windows, Linux OS and storage systems like NetApp makes the product a very powerful software to support IT management, System administration and IT Support.

Correlating the IOPs seen by the ESXi VMkernel and the virtual machine additionally to NetApp Storage metrics, let you dive into a 360° view in one Dashboard engine instead of switching between multiple management tools of different vendors. All that is possible at a very affordable and attractive price. So don´t wait, start evaluating how Performance Analyzer can save your day!
