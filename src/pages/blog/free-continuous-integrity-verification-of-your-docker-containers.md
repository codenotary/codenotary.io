In our last blog ([here)](https://www.codenotary.io/blog/verify-the-integrity-of-a-docker-image-for-free-with-codenotary/), we showed how to sign and verify your build code. With an established baseline, we’ll move on to the really cool stuff that will make your life a whole lot easier. Below are the few, simple steps you can take to get next level, free continuous integrity verification of your [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/) containers. This way as a developer anytime you execute a Docker run command for any over your numerous containers, you can be sure your code is 100% safe the way you intended it to be.

 

## **VCN Watchdog for Container Protection**

 

We developed VCN Watchdog so you can maintain continuous verification of your Docker runtime environment. Watchdog continuously monitors your environment in order to prevent unknown and/or compromised containers from being executed.

 

### **How to use VCN Watchdog**

 

One of the great things about VCN Watchdog is it can monitor any functionality you want and alert you accordingly.

 

Check out the project and edit the `verify` file by customizing your monitoring alerts to whatever you want.

 

You will need to make sure your /var/run/docker.sock is accessible.

 

Then run this on your server:

 

 

**docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d**

And you are good to go.

 

### **Design of VCN Watchdog**

 

This tool is designed as a sidecar for your existing Docker runtime environment. All running containers are continuously checked via CodeNotary vcn for integrity. If a container fails the verification check, then a customizable alert is triggered and you will be notified.

 

### **Conclusion** 

 

That’s it. Now you know how to get **free continuous integrity verification** of your Docker containers. It really is that simple.

 

Thanks to the innovative use of **blockchain and smart contract technology**, you now can iterate faster, more securely and at lower costs. Gaining immutable integrity using the CodeNotary vcn tool saves you from a lot of headaches and remediation costs. Additional ways CodeNotary benefits you include:
