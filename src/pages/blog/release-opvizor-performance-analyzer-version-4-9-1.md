We're thrilled to announce the new release 4.9.1 of our extremely popular Performance Analyzer product to monitor and analyze your virtual environment. We spent a lot of time to improve the chart and panel hints to explain performance bottlenecks and the shown metrics. Furthermore, we added a lot of functionality for Cisco (Cisco UCS and Cisco HyperFlex) as well as NetApp Solidfire. Of course we also fixed some bugs and added lots of new metrics to extend our dashboards.

Last but not least, we support VMware Horizon View session (PCoIP and Blast protocol) performance data collection to monitor response time, data throughput and frames per second.
