We're working hard to bring the next Hypervisor integration to Performance Analyzer: Nutanix Prism Element and Nutanix Prism Central (AHV)

Gathering performance metrics from Nutanix AHV, the Guest OS (Windows or Linux) and the applications running within (Databases, Webserver, ...) brings you to a new level of visibility. Of course we still support hybrid environments, that run VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V and soon Nutanix AHV.
