- Jenkins on AWS
- AWS Database Migration Service Best Practices

and also white papers from Amazon partners, e.g.

- Oracle Database 12c on the AWS Cloud

## Amazon Web Services – Architecting for the Cloud: AWS Best Practices

[Abstract](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS_Cloud_Best_Practices.pdf) 

> This whitepaper is intended for solutions architects and developers who are building solutions that will be deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides architectural patterns and advice on how to design systems that are secure, reliable, high performing, and cost efficient. It includes a discussion on how to take advantage of attributes that are specific to the dynamic nature of cloud computing (elasticity, infrastructure automation, etc.). In addition, this whitepaper also covers general patterns, explaining how these are evolving and how they are applied in the context of cloud computing.

## The New Way

If you're looking for a very modern way to check and monitor performance, you should give [Performance Analyzer a try](http://try.opvizor.com/opvizor-perfanalyzer-product-page/). 

Monitor and Analyze your Amazon Web Services infrastructure separately or combined with your multi-cloud environment. Troubleshoot bottlenecks and capacity issues in minutes using AWS Cloudwatch and preconfigured dashboards. Easy integration and a great combination to our vSphere plugin to predict future needs or support future directions.

Watch current and estimated charges of your Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment per type of service.

Some of our AWS integration features are:

- Gather all information and metrics available in AWS Cloudwatch
- Billing and Cost Estimates
- Set important thresholds for your EC2, RDS or SQS services on custom metrics
- Use RDS Database I/O and Size trends to plan capacity and performance ahead
- Combine with Guest OS or Guest App data
- Combine with other private cloud Hypervisor to create a multi-cloud sourced Visualization
- Share results and real-time dashboard with your team

Check your AWS EC2 performance

- Visualize real-time and historical performance metrics of your EC2 Instances
- Find Disk I/O bottlenecks
- Report Used Capacity over time and plan future capacity
- Full insights into Datastore Latency and VM Disk IOps
- See Memory Constraints and Network Issues instantly
- Get a complete usage overview across multiple environments
- Set important thresholds based on custom metrics

Check your AWS RDS Database performance

- Visualize real-time and historical performance metrics of your RDS Server
- Set important thresholds for your Cloud Database based on custom metrics
- Use Database I/O and Size trends to plan capacity and performance ahead
- Full insights into Disk Latency and Disk IOps of the underlying operating system

Support for SQS, RDS, EC2, Cloudfront, Cloudwatch, EBS and much more

Combine all with Guest OS information, other Hypervisor (VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V)  or Container (Docker) and applications (SQL Server, Web Server)
