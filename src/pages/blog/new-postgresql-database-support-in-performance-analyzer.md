We're more than happy to announce a new database integration in Performance Analyzer: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

As we already have support for Microsoft SQL server and Oracle for quite some time, we noticed a great interest from our customer base to add PostgreSQL as well.

When running Performance Analyzer 6, you need to make sure to install the 6.2.5 patch and the PostgreSQL license to have the options available to add the database servers.

Please have your PostgreSQL server network dns or ip address ready and a database user that can access the database metrics.

Adding the database server including all databases to the data (metrics) collector is as simple as always using Performance Analyzer, just click add.

Next thing you can see is a new dashboard and the data flowing into:

The header section allows you to select between the database servers and databases.

We don't just collect the server settings, all kinds of metrics and counters, we also show sessions, the queries and their runtime.
