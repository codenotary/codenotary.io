The hybrid cloud offers a number of benefits, making it a popular business solution: it provides on-demand access to IT resources when developing new software and applications and easy management of existing applications, as well. Many enterprises and large organizations turn to the VMware vCloud Hybrid Service for their hybrid cloud needs. Not only are most IT departments already familiar with working in VMware, but it offers a secure infrastructure that is critical in enterprise and organizational infrastructures.

What are some of the most [common use cases](https://blogs.vmware.com/vcloud/2014/01/top-5-use-cases-for-moving-to-a-hybrid-cloud-solution.html) for VMware and the hybrid cloud?

## 1\. Using the Cloud for Storage and Backup

_Whether you need affordable archiving or flexible storage capacity, the hybrid cloud is ideal for centralizing and securing data storage._

This use case is the most natural way to ease into the hybrid cloud. Using the [hybrid cloud for storage](http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2015/02/16/hybrid-cloud-continues-grow-look-real-use-cases/) and backup is an excellent way to centralize storage for easy access by all of your applications and users. vCloud Hybrid Service is built on vSphere, which handles all of the replication, VMware monitoring, and allocation of resources. It is ideal for structuring an environment that is tolerant of service disruptions due to connection issues or hardware glitches.

## 2\. Moving Packaged Applications to the Hybrid Cloud

IT departments frequently have to contend with the frustration associated with on-demand capacity, especially during times of change. Relocating [packaged applications to the hybrid cloud](http://www.infoq.com/zones/assets/downloads/WhitePaper_Top_5_Use_Cases_for_Moving_to_a_Hybrid_Cloud.pdf) can solve this issue. Packaged applications like email and collaboration tools allow you to transfer those workloads without the need to write code or even deal with the hassle of reconfigurations. There are no additional security concerns, no loss of availability, and no degradation in performance. Plus, the users are already used to working with the apps in your own IT environment.

## 3\. Moving E-Commerce & Websites to the Hybrid Cloud

Online commerce and retail shops are a natural fit in the cloud. You can empower dynamic resource allotment and assure that all compliance regulations are met. The hybrid cloud delivers security, is more cost-effective than managing websites and e-commerce sites via traditional in-house-only methods, and is powerfully scalable. The hybrid cloud allows for fast deployment of related applications and you can transfer your existing IT policies straight to the hybrid cloud.

## 4\. Moving the Datacenter to the Hybrid Cloud

This is an extension of migrating your storage and backups to the hybrid cloud. Cloud-based data centers offer significant cost savings, as well as a centralized and more manageable infrastructure. You can also leverage the hybrid cloud to test out new data center structures and applications, such as building a data lake or creating a NoSQL database to undertake Big Data initiatives.

## 5\. Moving Development & Testing Projects to the Hybrid Cloud

_The cloud is ideal for inexpensive, scalable, flexible, and secure development and testing environments._

Just as when trying out a new NoSQL database or testing out a data lake, the hybrid cloud is an inexpensive and highly flexible testing grounds. Using it as a testing and development platform eliminates that workload from your own IT environment, meaning your test projects aren't competing for resources with your actual productive workloads.

Don't even consider taking on the challenges of VMware without the right VMware monitoring solution.Â
