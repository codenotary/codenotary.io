_Virtualization is all about security, delivery, and better resource allocation. Are you on board with "One Cloud, Any Application, Any Device"?_

While the primary focus was on new products and improvements for business and organizational users, Day One featured some philanthropic efforts, as well. The organization GlobalGiving was offered a donation to assist their efforts in charitable organizations that serve Argentina, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Peru, Tanzania, the United States, and Vietnam.

## Announcements for Updates, Improvements, and New Products

On the business-organizational side, VMworld was abuzz with announcements relative to VMware's architecture, "One Cloud, Any, Application, Any Device". This architecture is designed to enable multiple clouds to operate as a single cloud. It's all about secure management and improved delivery of resources and applications. Other notable announcements included developments in VMware's hybrid cloud management, multi-vendor, service provider clouds, and hybrid cloud application delivery. The software-defined data center (SDDC) was also prominently featured at VMworld 2015. This places virtualization at the center of storage, networks, and security.

## VMworld Europe 2015 Day One

On the first day, Joe Baguley made a number of significant announcements, most notably important updates to VMware vRealize Automation 7. These improvements are designed to make it faster for VMware developers to deploy and improve their digital business initiatives.

VMware vCloud Air and the VMware vCloud Air Network (VCAN) were also discussed by Baguley. VCAN features a portfolio of over 4,000 cloud service providers around the world, all built on the same VMware products used in the enterprise. VMware also announced new NFV (network functions virtualization), which are intended to help CSPs (Communications Service Providers) to speed transition to the telco cloud architecture via the implementation of NFV.

## VMworld Europe 2015 Day Two

Boxer brings new social and intra networking capabilities to the table for future VMware developments.

On the second day of the event, VMware announced their intentions to [acquire email application Boxer](https://blogs.vmware.com/euc/2015/10/vmworld-europe-2015.html). Boxer has managed to produce a next-gen PIM (personal information management) solution designed for the enterprise that aligns essential business applications with internal and social networking solutions like Twitter, Outlook, Yahoo!, Box, Evernote, Facebook, Box, Gmail, iCloud, Salesforce, etc.

As VMware breaks out of the enterprise and offers more to the small and mid-size businesses, expect even more new products and improvements to old products to pack conference centers around the world.
