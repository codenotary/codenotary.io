# Enjoy the International Workers' Day (Labour Day)

If you have a day off today - Enjoy and relax!

**Our goal at Opvizor is to ensure that you can enjoy any holidays without the fear of vSphere downtime.**

> Being a traditional European spring celebration, May Day is a national public holiday in many countries, but in only some of those countries is it celebrated specifically as "Labour Day" or "International Workers' Day". Some countries celebrate a Labour Day on other dates significant to them, such as the United States which celebrates Labor Day on the first Monday of September.
