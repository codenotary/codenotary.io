Dana Bull is a marketing specialist with vendor-independent software company [Leostream](https://www.leostream.com/). We recently checked in with Dana to learn more about Leostream and how companies are embracing virtualization today. Here's what she had to say:

**Can you tell us about Leostream. What are you known for?** 

Leostream is a driver in the evolving virtualization space and a leader in the management of end-user resources hosted in the data center. Our connection broker product provides a comprehensive and scalable solution for organizations to deliver and manage desktops, remote sessions and hosted applications to end-users. It's our flexibility to support the multiple technology stacks you typically find across large enterprises that makes us crucial to the success of deployments and well-known. Our solution is the most widely deployed vendor neutral connection broker on the market today. 

**What are the most common pain points your clients come to you with? How do you help them?** 

More often than not, our customers seek us out when they are stuck. They need to integrate a piece of technology that no one else can. Or, they want to future-proof their design. We provide tools that allow our customers to manage user assignments and connections to hosted desktop environments in whatever platform they choose, whether they want a virtual or physical infrastructure, a publicly or privately hosted data center, a Windows or Linux operating system, or any of a number of high-performance display protocols. 

**Why are companies embracing virtual operating systems more? What are the advantages?** 

The advantages of moving to a virtual environment are well documented. Hosting desktops in the datacenter improves data security, allows organizations to save power, and centralizes desktop management. These benefits are particularly important in verticals such as healthcare and financial services. By keeping data secure in the data center, organizations are at a lower risk for losing data due to end-point loss or breech. 

**What types of industries seem to be the most interested in VMware?** 

We manage some of the world's largest hosted desktop deployments in banking, government, oil and gas, healthcare, and education. VMware is a common technology that we support in many of these industries. 

**What are some of the innovative ways you've seen it being used?** 

Over the years, we've had some interesting use cases and environments present themselves. Some of the innovative ways that we've seen recently are around hybrid deployments. For example, customers have built out solutions on-site and then bursting into the cloud to support peak demand. 

**What considerations should companies make when introducing virtualization? What precautions should they take?** 

Your hosted desktop environment, whether it is a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) or a physical hosted desktop infrastructure (HDI), needs to be robust, highly resistant to failure, and flexible enough to meet individual user needs, but there are a host of other questions that need to be addressed in order to ensure a successful VDI rollout.Here are five items that need to be be considered before transitioning to a large-scale VDI deployment: 

1\. A plan for handling multiple technologies and mixed physical/virtual environments. 

2\. What display protocol will you use? Do you need more than one? 

3\. How will you handle directory services and authentication. 

4\. What type of granular control do you need over the desktops? 

5\. How do you want to map users to the resources? 

**What advice do you find yourself repeating to clients over and over about using VMWare?** 

The connection broker OVA-file can be used with VMware vSphere 5.x or 6.x, or VMware Workstation 9 or higher. We always recommend keeping the software up-to-date in order to take advantage of new features as they become available.

**What virtualization trends or innovations are you following right now? What excites you about them?** 

We are seeing a lot of interesting trends taking shape. From Linux VDI and OpenStack virtual desktops, to public cloud deployments and container technology, these trends are turning heads. We recently [published a whitepaper](https://www.leostream.com/whitepaper/top-5-desktop-virtualization-trends-to-look-for-in-2016) which goes into depth about these topics and can be downloaded from our website.**[Sign up for Snapwatcher](https://mediashower.com/ce2/42483/3/4744).**
