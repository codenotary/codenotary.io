# opvizor Health Analyzer - VMware Inventory report

Over the next weeks we're covering some of our report capabilities we offer within opvizor Health Analyzer additionally to our huge rule base to find existing VMware configuration, security or performance issues.

All functionality is accessible as-a-Service, marketing would call it Healthcheck-as-a-Service and Reports-as-a-Service and on-premise. Please either [register](https://www.opvizor.com/register) for SaaS or contact us for [on-premise](http://try.opvizor.com/onpremise)

We want to start with the **VMware Inventory report** that is typically used for two scenarions:

- Compliance and change tracking
- Document currentÂ status and configuration

As the report can be generated as HTML, PDF or CSV file there is no limitation in further processing or customizing to your needs.

Of course you don't need to login, generate and download the report every time you need it. We offer a simple way to schedule the report generation and it will be sent to you by email.

Last but not least, although you can access and read the VM report information with real cleartext data, our software is fully aware of anonymization. Therefore even when uploading anonymized data, you get the real data in your inbox. That is possible as our local opvizor service is owning the anonymization convertion data and is deanonymizing all report content locally (in your datacenter) before sending it out via your local mail server. Your Host names, VM names, IP addresses, Portgroup names never leave your datacenter.
