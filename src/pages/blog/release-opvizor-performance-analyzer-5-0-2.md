We’re thrilled to announce the new release 5.0.2 of our famous Performance Analyzer product to monitor and analyze your virtual datacenter and much more. 

That release is packed with performance improvements of our back-end and front-end. We spent several months to further improve and speed up our data collector engine, the time series performance without asking for more resources. 

The opposite is true as the new release required less CPU cycles and disk space up front. The front-end has been upgraded as well and the dashboards chart caching has been optimized to decrease the loading times, especially in larger environments.

If you´re a storage geek, we have a real goodie for you! Integration of **vSCSIstats** data collection! Configurable on demand and made for storage troubleshooting.
