There are numerous security measures a developer can perform but nearly half (48%) of all developers say they don’t have enough time to do so. They know security is important but with an often demanding schedule they end up concentrating on developing for functionality instead of security. This kind of thought process can lead to vulnerabilities in code and containers alike. “Security? With what time? My continuous integration backlog is overflowing.” We hear you. Security and integrity is a time-consuming responsibility but CodeNotary makes it easy for you to implement.

 

## **Project Juggling and Development**

 

With time in limited supply, spending it wisely is a high priority for developers. That and effective time management is a widely sought after skill as well as an industry best practice. Coders are incessantly driving to maximize their productivity.

 

Never ask a developer, “Really, how many lines of code did you produce today?”

 

Speed in DevOps clearly has its advantages but it can also lead to compromises due to hastily published misconfigurations and errors being put into production.

 

Coding is a complex skill. It takes time to do it right. Considering miscommunications and everything else that can cause project backlogs to pile up ([here](http://www.projectcartoon.com/cartoon/2)’s a funny cartoon about it), time is in an ever-increasing shorter supply. This often leaves security concerns to become afterthoughts, if even that.

 

## **Fallout from Continuous Integration**

 

With the never-ending battle between white hats and black hats and the constant march towards continuous integration inevitably leaving new zero-day exploits in its wake, new security measures are constantly emerging.

 

The good news is you can employ some good practices to help significantly mitigate your security risk.

 

The bad news is that they all take more of your time and tip the balance away from you doing what dev does best - writing code. For example, [this](http://www.devseccon.com/blog/2018/11/05/9-practical-steps-to-secure-your-container-deployment/) list by DevSecCon is a good set of 9 recommendations on how to secure containers before deployment. But what the list doesn’t do is help you to get more security in less time, which is the ideal.

 

## **A Solution for Time-Crunched Devs**

 

Here’s one solution we came up with to help you maintain 100% confidence in your containers and gain security over your build environments. CodeNotary’s 1-step verification open source software takes seconds and delivers blockchain backed reputational liability protection. Additionally, it's used in your continuous integration pipelines allows you to increase your productivity by spending substantially less time doing security reviews and remediations after breaches. You know instantly if your code has been compromised. Today with the immutability of blockchain, code integrity guaranteed by CodeNotary is a lightning fast, pervasive and repository agnostic reality.

 

Check out our Jenkins Integration [here](https://www.codenotary.io/integrations/) or test drive CodeNotary for yourself with a complimentary 15-day trial. And bonus, if you’re an OSS and non-commercial developer, your license is free....forever.
