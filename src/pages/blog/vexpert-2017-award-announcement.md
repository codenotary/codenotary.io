every year we are looking forward to the announcement of VMware. Please join with us the latest news regarding the new VMware vExpert Award 2017.

We just received a notification that our CEO, Dennis Zimmer has been awarded with the VMware vExpert title for 2017. The current vExpert count is 1 472 people and it was the ninth year (2009-2017 - less than 50 people received 9 VMware vExperts in a row!) he was awarded with the title. Read more about the [VMware vExpert 2017 Announcement on the VMware official blog](https://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2017/02/vexpert-2017-award-announcement.html?src=vmw_so_vex_mande_12).

All VMware vExperts are listed in the [VMware vExpert Directory](https://communities.vmware.com/vexpert.jspa?src=vmw_so_vex_mande_12) so congrats to all of you!
