We're excited to share the news that we support Aleksandra Jozefow, a sculptor from Poland. From now on, all of her artworks will be immutably authenticated using CodeNotary, so that everyone can verify the certificate and the origin.

**Aleksandra Jozefow, Gdansk (Poland) based Sculptor**

The year is 2021 and the Fourth Industrial Revolution is in full swing.

Within the European Artistic community, there is a growing sense that, across artistic disciplines, dramatic events are unfolding; that ultimately, only the artists who will have understood the importance of the fourth industrial revolution&#39;s technological stack, and will have done something about it, will remain relevant.

Artists, clinging to Traditionalism (as can be shown, for example, by their very vocal opposition to Non-Fungible Tokens) are hesitant to fully embrace Industry 4.0.

As a sculptor, I have been looking for creative ways to integrate a very promising Industry 4.0 technology in my workflow: Blockchain Technology.

When a sculpture is completed and sold, a paper-based certificate of authenticity is issued by me and given to the buyer. This certificate states that only one copy of this work exists, that it is authentic.

But, I thought, don&#39;t Blockchain or similar technologies provide a better way to do this? Why not authenticate sculptures cryptographically from everywhere in the world?

As soon as I saw and tried [CodeNotary](http://CodeNotary/)&#39;s solution (www.codenotary.com), I understood this was a powerful tool, and one I wanted to integrate in my workflow.

A sculpture&#39;s characteristics such as: name, materials used, year, specifications such as size and weight, etc. can be stored tamperproof thanks to CodeNotary&#39;s [CLI tool](https://github.com/codenotary/vcn) and within a few minutes, all of this information can be viewed and shared with customers, curators and collectors around the world and its authenticity is cryptographically verifiable.

Using CodeNotary was truly eye-opening for me.

Not only does it drastically reduce my paper-trail, but this information about my works, stored in an immutable platform, can be easily queried and leveraged by applications. My current focus is to build - with some help! - simple, proprietary applications that will leverage this information, applications that will be used in the context of exhibitions.
