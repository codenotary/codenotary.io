# VMware Embraces 'People-Centric' Computing as Opposed to 'Device-Centric' Computing: What This Means for VMware Monitoring & More

Most IT products have historically been developed as device-centric applications. In other words, the software is designed to work with a specific device or hardware system. Until recently, this model worked fine. Businesses and individuals chose the hardware with the specifications they wanted to use, then selected software (such as VMware monitoring tools or other applications) that were compatible with that hardware (except, of course, in instances where the software comes preinstalled, which is often the case, limiting users' decisions even further).But today's users -- and the IT world in general -- are different sorts of people. 

Today's users want software to be compatible with all of their devices. They want to be able to merge work and personal activities across their various devices, and to access their files, applications, etc. from their desktop computers, portable laptops and tablets, and even their smartphones.This means that software needs to be people-centric, not device-centric. The trend isn't just driven by users, either. 

Businesses want to be able to have one team and a single set of tools and processes to deliver software, content, and more across various devices to all of their users. In many cases, these users are spread across the country or even around the world. Most businesses are having to care for at least two separate management silos: one for desktop users and another for mobile users. This makes for inconsistent policy enforcement, a lack of central governance, and even a broken identity across the IT department. 

One world exists for physical endpoints, while another is solely dedicated to virtualized environments. 

## **VMware Introduces People-Centric Design with Project A2**

_Windows 10 is an excellent example of how people-centric computing is shaping the industry._ 

Windows 10 delivers a cohesive, streamlined experience to users across work and personal devices. Expect more software application developers to follow suit, combining the teams that work on desktop, mobile, physical, and virtual environments. In order to enable people-centric computing, VMware (as well as other big tech companies) has begun to roll out products to support this movement. 

For example, Windows 10 is designed to work for each user, across devices, and to provide a seamless user experience with consistent applications and data access for all of those devices. Likewise, VMware has introduced Project A2, which is a centralized management solution designed to allow businesses to deliver applications and enforce policies consistently across all desktop and mobile environments. 

Project A2 will allow you to simplify the application management afforded by VMware App Volumes to physical endpoints. It will also provide an easier way to migrate to Windows 10 while still managing legacy PC environments. 

**VMware Also Includes People-Centric Design in Products Like Identity Manager & NSX**

_VMware has begun building the concepts of people-centric computing into many of their products already, including Identity Manager, NSX, Horizon, and Project A2. Expect this trend to continue as VMware rolls out new products designed to make it easier to manage a variety of users and devices._ 

 However, new tools for VMware monitoring and the like can't just be focused on the distribution of the application. There has to be a way to assure the security of the content distributed. This means secure sign-in, secure VPN connections for each application, etc. VMware is addressing these issues with other new products, like Identity Manager and NSX. 

 **VMware Horizon 6.2 Offers People-Centric Features & Functionality Too**

_The people who use the devices are more important than the devices themselves. IT has to realize that failing to deliver the experience users demand is a large contributing factor to shadow IT, which is damaging to the business, the customers, and the reputation of the IT department._ 

VMware has also built people-centric features and functionality into products like VMware Horizon. In the release of Horizon 6.2, VMware included enhancements like: 

- More efficient management and delivery of applications at scale, which should ensure a rich user experience when deploying to global, multi-site virtual environments. 
- An improved user experience through support of Skype for Business, as well as the most current NVIDIA GRID virtual graphics processing unit. 
- Support for all-flash storage options to lower costs and improve performance via the new VMware Virtual SAN.
- Improved security capabilities, which includes support for options like biometric fingerprint authentication. 
- Compliance improvements, such as FIPS 140-2 compliance and readiness for other governmental regulations. 

People-centric computing isn't just limited to VMware monitoring and other tools. It is evident across the IT industry. It is largely a response to growing tensions between users -- who want to use the same applications, access the same data, and receive similar experiences across all of their work and personal devices -- and the IT department, which wants more control over the environment for management, governance, security, and related purposes. 

A lack of flexibility on the part of IT has been a huge contributor to the [problem of shadow IT](http://www.informationweek.com/strategic-cio/it-strategy/shadow-it-8-ways-to-cope/d/d-id/1319535), in which users simply go around the limitations imposed by IT by using outside applications and storage options, like Dropbox and Google Docs. IT is gradually realizing that in order to curtail the growth of dangerous shadow IT activities, they must begin providing a user experience that works across all of the users' personal and work devices. Hence, IT is finally on board with the people-centric computing concept. 

In addition to VMware, large software proprietors like [Microsoft](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/24/what_does_people_centric_it_mean/), AppSense, and others have also begun to embrace the people-centric computing ideology, evident in products like Windows 10.Are you in search of more information about the happenings in VMware and across the world of technology?
