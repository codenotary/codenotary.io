# Look Out, VMware: Ubuntu 15.10 is Released Into the Wild & What This Means for VMware Monitoring

Canonical released Ubuntu 15.10 in October of 2015. Nicknamed [Wiley Werewolf](http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-wily-werewolf-ubuntu-15-10-is-unleashed/), it is available for download, and comes with a number of new features and improvements. It comes with Linux Kernel 4.2, which itself features a number of changes and improvements, including support for AMD GPU driver, NCQ TRIM handling, F2FS per-file encryption, queue spinlocks, and a number of new or newly updated drivers. As the go-to operating system for most VMware environments and [VMware monitoring](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VMware), here is what you need to know about the all-new version.

## Ubuntu 15.10 Features the Unity 7.3.2 Desktop

_Ubuntu 15.10 features the Unity 7.3.2 desktop experience._

Ubuntu 15.10 features Unity as its primary desktop. Currently, Unity is in version 7.3.2. This version features lots of bug fixes, plus some improvements that make the desktop experience sleeker and more usable. Unity 7.3.2 also features drag and drop apps to create shortcuts from dash to desktop, page up and page down keyboard nav that works as a scroll from the dash, and a fix to eliminate computer shut down when the screen is locked, among [many other new handy features](https://launchpad.net/unity/+milestone/7.3.2).

## Ubuntu 15.10 Features GNOME Stack 3.16 

[Ubuntu 15.10](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/10/22/whats-new-in-ubuntu-15-10-desktop-and-devices/) also comes with GNOME stack version 3.16x. 

However, the Nautilus file manager for Ubuntu 15.10 still comes with version 3.14 and Gedit text editor (which dates way back to March 2010). 

Ubuntu 15.10 comes with GNOME overlay scrollbars, replacing Unity's for GTK3 apps.

## Ubuntu Make in Version 15.10

Make is Ubuntu's command-line utility, which allows users to gain access to the most current version of all the popular Ubuntu development tools via quick and easy download. Ubuntu Make supports more platforms than ever before, plus tons more frameworks and services and other handy tools for developers.

## Stateless Persistent Network Interface Names

If you've grown tired of the limited naming system of the old versions, you'll be happy to know that your options just opened up considerably.

Ubuntu 15.10 marks the rollout of all new stateless persistent network interface names. This feature means that developers will no longer be relegated to naming network interfaces things like etho0 or eth1. Now, developers can take advantage of more comprehensive, descriptive, and relevant naming systems. Additionally, names remain valid even if you have to restart or if the hardware is completely taken out of the environment.

## Ubuntu 15.10 Features Steam Controller Support

Also in the Wiley Werewolf release of Ubuntu, Ubuntu Developer adds support for Steam Controller. As it stands now, the Steam package can only be obtained with Ubuntu 15.10, but do not rule out the possibility that this patch might be tacked on to some other distributions. In other words, users of 15.10 can simply plug and play the new controller and open Steam, with no need to read and apply complicated or confusing advice from tutorials.
