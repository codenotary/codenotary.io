# Disable vMotion & AMP On A Virtual Machine

As the heading implies people always used to ask this question as how can we easily disable vMotion on a virtual machine? But this is not a very easy task to handle with. You can get through this task. This happens when an error occurs in the process of network sharing in virtual machines. At times you want to migration of some virtual machines due to varied reasons. This might occur because of the collapse that happens with the firewall, or a problem with integration. There are many programs designed to remove vMotion from a particular virtual machine. That was a very tough task to complete.

## What Is vMotion?

In virtualization, VMware provides the clients migration from one virtual machine to another within a fraction of time or zero downtime, without any problem arising in integration of data. vMotion will let you optimize the data usage from the pooling of data made available. It increases the availability and utilization of resources shared. vMotion works on the principle of transferring the data in a capsule or in a nutshell. This process happens on a high speed. It helps to migration of data without letting sever to get down in its process. This process lets the virtual machine work faster without disturbing the actual work running on the machine.vMotion targets to copy the entire file from actual server to a virtual machine. Once the data are fully copied, vMotion suspends itself from the server. Even after migration, vMotion ensures itself that it works on a migrated network, but it remembers the principal place of data being stored. After transferring the data, vMotion finds the router between actual server and virtual machine. Once it gets the routers, automatically the virtual machine starts its processes. All these processes happen in a zero downtime.

## Storage In vMotion

What do we mean by storage in vMotion? We prefer for virtualization to store the integrated and accumulated data at one point. Pooling of data has gained its importance in these days. Organization is vast and scattered in a large area you acquire the importance of sharing the data among the departments in the organization itself. Data storage is the challenging task in IT departments. You need to save the data with proper recovery options if data is lost. So vMotion is the key to save your data in virtualization process. You have applications to drive your vMotion in a correct path.

## Advantages Of vMotion On Virtualization

There are many advantages in vMotion on virtual machines.It lets you transfer of data in zero downtime. It gets the transfer work done within seconds without affecting the actual ongoing work. This is will be found as great advantage when you are in the process of completing an assignment.Using plug-ins manager, you can easily install vMotion on your virtual machine and store the data ensuring more security. It reduces your work load and lets you to concentrate on other core activities. Once installed, it automatically optimizes the data stored in its memory.

## Why To Disable vMotion on A Particular Virtual Machine?

It is easy to remove vMotion from all machines. In virtualization it would be a hard task to disable vMotion from a particular machine. Disabling vMotion from a particular machine is the challenging task faced by many of the programmers. There might be an error or some sort of hacking or risk of data security arises in a particular machine, at that point you need to disable the accessibility of one machine.Virtualization is created to pool the data at one place. Data being centralized programmers find it to be a hard task to disable vMotion on one particular machine. This process has a long history. From the first day of [virtualization](http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/enhanced-app-performance.html) this was the question arise by many of the users.

_You don't like your regular work be affected._

## How To Disable vMotion On A Particular Virtual Machine?

Nowadays there are many solutions given by the programmers. One common program among them is downloading [PowerCLI](http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html) script on your personal computer. Once you install this you will get the options as enable or disable virtual machine on your [vSphere](http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/). Then you must select the option as disable. Give the name of the specific machine you want to disable. Once the script is given, you must run the application to disable the particular machine. There are options for migrations also. You can choose the other way. You have solutions to migrate the specific control also.You can opt for programmers or just do it by yourself by following the above method. Programmers are the best option to save your time. No matter you can try it by yourself also. Usually the major problem that will occur during the process of disabling is your regular work might be affected. So the important point to be considered before the process is that you must ensure yourself that your work is not changed. Your schedule goes on. There is a complex set of rules which you might find it to be a hard task.

You have various other ways to get through the process of disabling. You can also enter into the vAdministrator and get to the home page and have a view about the headings in the home page. Once you look into these web pages you will get an idea. There is an icon named roles. Click on the icon and feed the name of the machine you want to disable. There is an icon as privileges, just deselect the migrating on a particular virtual machine. You can also restrict use on a particular virtual machine. There is an icon as permissions. Just click that icon and restrict the permission. After applying just ensure yourself that the particular task is achieved on the required machine.To conclude with, you can definitely go for vMotion on your virtual machine for storage and optimizing your data. This will help you manage your data effectively. It saves your time on transferring the data using other applications from server to the virtual machine.
