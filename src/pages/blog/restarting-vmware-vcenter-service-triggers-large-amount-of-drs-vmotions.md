A customer of us was affected by a large number of DRS vMotions and could find that using our vMotion/Storage vMotion report. That report tracks all vMotion and Storage vMotion activities and can be a great help to find large amounts of VM migrations and large vmdk data transfers. ![vMotion and Storage vMotion report restarting VMware vCenter](/images/blog/vmotionreport-300x300.png)

He noticed that all the vMotion tasks were triggered by the system (DRS) and at a certain time. Actually some minutes after **restarting VMware vCenter**.

Our support could help and we pointed the customer to the following [VMware KB article 2107950](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2107950)
