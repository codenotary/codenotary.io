Release v0.7.0 - multi-database support, more resilience, even better performance, improved documentation

immudb is getting faster and stronger! This release brings new features, even better performance and more resilience to immudb!

Summary of the most relevant points:

- Multi-database support (you can run many databases with one immudb server to separate data or to provide multi-tenancy)
- Enhanced user management (per database)
- Automated service and data recovery in case of unexpected OS or container crashes
- Improved service management for Microsoft Windows
- 100+ times faster cryptographic proofs (we completely revised and optimized the methods for entry validation; but don't worry, the API methods didn't change)
- Improved documentation for gRPC and structured value

Thanks for the amazing community feedback and contribution!

# Changelog

# \[v0.7.0\] - 2020-08-10

### Bug Fixes

- userlist returns wrong message when logged in as immudb with single database
- use dedicated logger for store
- fix compilation error in corruption checker test
- race condition in token eviction

- user list showing only the superadmin user even when other user exist
- fix multiple services config uninstall
- skip loading databases from disk when in memory is requested
- if custom port is <= 0 use default port for both immudb and immugw
- fix immugw failing to start with nil pointer dereference since gRPC dial options are inherited (bug was introduced in commit a4477e2e403ab35fc9392e0a3a2d8436a5806901)
- remove os.Exit(0) from disconnect method
- fix DefaultPasswordReader initialization. fixes [#404](https://github.com/vchain-us/immudb/issues/404)
