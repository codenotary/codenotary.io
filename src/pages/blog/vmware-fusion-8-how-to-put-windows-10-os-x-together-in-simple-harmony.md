The Windows 10 operating system marks a drastic change from all previous operating systems. 

Using VMware Fusion 8 (in fact, [version 7](http://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2015/07/discover-windows-10-on-fusion.html) also offers many of these capabilities, as well), Mac users can use and enjoy all of the Windows 10 applications, without having to migrate to Windows/Microsoft machines and operating system. 

 Not too many years ago, there was positively nothing compatible about Windows and Mac. But today's machines are made to be more compatible, and with tools like VMware, you can take advantage of both operating systems on a single machine. There are a few ways to do this: you can use VMware Fusion 8 to run both Windows 10 and OS X together, or to hide Windows 10 but continue to use all of its applications. 

  **Maximize the Screen for Easier Viewing**

_Mac users are more enthusiastic about Windows 10 than any other version of Windows so far. It marks a drastic deviation from Microsoft Windows versions of old, especially the tremendously unpopular Windows 8. With VMware Fusion, you can enjoy all of the Windows applications without using the Windows 10 interface at all._ 

The first thing you might want to do is to [resize the virtual machine window](http://www.groovypost.com/howto/windows-10-vmware-fusion-8-tips/) so that you can see more on the screen. You can resize the screen using the mouse pointer, or you can click the Maximize button to go into full-screen mode. Once in full-screen mode, you can go back to OS X, where VMware Fusion will allow you to use gestures like the 3-finger swipe, which will allow you to easily navigate into and out of each OS. 

Swipe to the right to enter OS X, and swipe to the left to enter Windows 10. To exit full-screen mode, hover the mouse pointer over the top of the screen and click on View. From there, select Single Window. You can also hover the mouse near the bottom of the screen in order to activate the OS X Dock while in full-screen mode. 

**Using Unity View** 

 VMware Fusion offers a feature called Unity View, which allows you to hide the Windows desktop, yet still continue to use all of your handy Windows applications. Apps you use will automatically open into Windows mode, allowing you to use them along side the OS X applications. You can also use the OS X Dock to launch and to minimize Windows applications. 

**Using the Windows Start Menu in OS X Global Menu Bar**

_VMware Fusion 8 allows you to utilize the popular Windows Start Menu directly from the Global Menu Bar on the Mac. This gives you the best of both worlds when it comes to fast and easy access of your files and documents._ 

VMware Fusion also provides fast and easy access to the Start menu, offered as a Global menu bar item, so that you can find and open files quickly.
