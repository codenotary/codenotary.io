VMware vExpert Emad Younis covered opvizor VMware health analyzer reporting features in his blog

"I recently received my vExpert NFR license from [opvizor](https://www.opvizor.com/) to try their health analyzer tool.  For a nice overview of the install process, [Michael White](https://twitter.com/mwVme) has a great [post](http://notesfrommwhite.net/2015/02/14/getting-opvizor-working-and-is-it-interesting-or-what/). There really isn’t much to the setup at all, and it is quick and easy to get up and running. Once the setup is complete, the dashboard with your VMware infrastructure info is available. [Roger Lund](https://twitter.com/rogerlund) navigates through the dashboard components in this [post](http://vbrainstorm.com/opvizor-inside-the-dashboard/). What I’m really looking to focus on are opvizor’s reporting capabilities."

Thanks Emad for blogging about our **VMware Health analyzer and reporter** functionality.
