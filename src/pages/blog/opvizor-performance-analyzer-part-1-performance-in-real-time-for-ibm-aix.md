Based on the IBM blog about using nmon command as a performance measurement or monitoring tool, this link is giving you in detail information: [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-analyze\_aix/](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-analyze_aix/)

The mentioned blog entry covers:

The nmon tool is designed for AIX and Linux performance specialists to use for monitoring and analyzing performance data, including:

- CPU utilization
- Memory use
- Kernel statistics and run queue information
- Disks I/O rates, transfers, and read/write ratios
- Free space on file systems
- Disk adapters
- Network I/O rates, transfers, and read/write ratios
- Paging space and paging rates
- CPU and AIX specification
- Top processors
- IBM HTTP Web cache
- User-defined disk groups
- Machine details and resources
- Asynchronous I/O -- AIX only
- Workload Manager (WLM) -- AIX only
- IBM TotalStorage® Enterprise Storage Server® (ESS) disks -- AIX only
- Network File System (NFS)
- Dynamic LPAR (DLPAR) changes -- only pSeries p5 and OpenPower for either AIX or Linux

Next to nmon, there are a couple of AIX commands known for performance monitoring / please see here:
