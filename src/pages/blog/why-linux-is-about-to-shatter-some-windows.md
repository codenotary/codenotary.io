Once upon a time, the business world adopted Windows, and it was good. Windows was so much easier for laypersons than trying to learn to use DOS or UNIX. It was stable, secure, and easy. But out of the blue came the dragon. The dragon ended support for stable, reliable, popular products like XP and the evil dragon had some really whack ideas, like Windows 8. Today, companies are forced to migrate off of their standbys like [Windows Server 2003](http://www.pcworld.com/article/201731/10_reasons_to_dump_windows_and_use_linux.html "Windows Server 2003"), and will soon be faced with another major OS migration when all support for Windows 7 ends in a couple of years. (Official support aside from security patches already ended in January of 2015.)

Add to that the issues with Windows 10, which [range from 'unpolished' to 'unfinished'](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/3erct1/my_main_problem_with_windows_10_currently/ "range from 'unpolished' to 'unfinished'"), and include the fact that you will never, ever, as long as the kingdom stands, [stop paying a monthly fee](http://betanews.com/2015/05/04/windows-10-free-can-potentially-cost-a-lot/ "stop paying a monthly fee") once the freebies come to an end. Microsoft will be in your pocket forever.

So, what are the fine lads and lassies supposed to do? Your best bet just might be Linux. As you'll see, this open source UNIX offspring has come a long way, baby. Here are a [few reasons](http://www.pcworld.com/article/201731/10_reasons_to_dump_windows_and_use_linux.html "few reasons") why Linux could soon shatter the world of Windows.

## Linux Offers Security

Since there are fewer Linux systems out there, it hasn't been worth hackers' time to target those systems as much as Windows. Furthermore Open Source and the community around it helps to get better insights. Additionally, there are reasons to believe that some of the Linux distros are inherently more secure than Windows and other proprietary products.

Diehard Linux fans will tell you that Linux is [inherently](http://www.pcworld.com/article/202452/why_linux_is_more_secure_than_windows.html "inherently") more secure. That may or may not be true, but as of yet it is largely untested. Aside from a very few malware instances, Linux just isn't targeted by hackers. This is because there are far more Windows systems, and if you're going to develop malware, you might as well target as many systems as possible. Will this change as more companies and users migrate to Linux? Probably. But in the meantime, you can benefit from an environment far less susceptible to data theft and malware.

## Linux Offers Stability

Like its big daddy UNIX, Linux systems can run for years without being rebooted or crashing. Windows users will need to go back and read that statement again, because getting through more than a day without a Windows crash can be justification for shameless bragging. Just kidding, but it's true, that the number of reboots (also due to updates) and crashes is significantly higher on Windows OS. You won't have nearly the issues with instability, crashes, and rebooting if you switch to Linux.

## Linux Offers Support

Linux support (or a lack thereof) used to be a major reason for avoiding it, but today's users just can't say that. Aside from the massive, worldwide support available from the passionate and knowledgeable Linux community, several vendors (Red Hat, Novell, Canonical) have hopped in and provided commercial support. Problem solved.

## Linux Offers Convenience

Are you over having to choose and install a new OS every few years? Don't want to buy new hardware just because a software company develops bloated stuff? Then Linux just might be for you.

Migrating a company's entire network off of an old operating system and onto a new one is a massive task. Window forces users to do that more and more frequently in recent years. But when you select a Linux distribution, you can stick with it for the long haul. Depending on the distro, new versions might come along a couple of times a year or once every few years, but nobody's going to force you to abandon your old OS until you're good and well ready to, by gosh.

## Linux Runs on Older Hardware

A few businesses are still running old systems that Microsoft (and other software vendors, frankly) would call obsolete. If you're still trying to milk more service out of your seasoned systems, Linux has no problem with that. Linux runs on x86 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, no problem. Keep the computers and ditch the Windows. (Psssst: it works just great for your [VMware virtual machine](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/24157/linux-distribution-geared-towards-developers "VMware virtual machine").)

## Linux is \*Free\*

How much did you pay for your business to upgrade to Windows XP or Windows 7? Have you ever gotten one of those sweet letters that Microsoft has lovingly selected your business for one of their [notoriously hideous software licensing audits](http://www.cio.com/article/2452991/microsoft-office/no-one-is-immune-to-microsofts-software-audits.html "notoriously hideous software licensing audits")? Linux is free and open source. Nobody will ever ask you to prove you've got a stinking license again.

## Linux Offers Lots of Apps

Almost every software application that you use with Windows either has a Linux version or a Linux equivalent. If you use lots of mainstream products like Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.), consider a popular and well-supported [Linux distro like Ubuntu](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2107641/3-easy-linux-alternatives-for-windows-xp-refugees-who-dont-want-a-new-pc.html "Linux distro like Ubuntu").

See? All your reasons for keeping Windows just shattered, and the Linux community lives happily ever.
