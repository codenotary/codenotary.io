When we started developing opvizor Health Analyzer as a SaaS offering we also thought about System Integrators or Consultants that want to use a single pane of glass across multiple customers (VMware landscape). 

Having an updated and direct view of the customers VMware environment is a great help to offer remote support and consulting. Just imagine a customer is adding a hundred more virtual machines but the environment was never planned for that. Before any performance complaints hitting your hotline you can already react and contact the customer with solutions before he falls into a trap.

Over time more and more consulting companies used opvizor as an enabler to offer remote managed services for VMware vSphere. In the beginning they just used multiple accounts in multiple browser windows. But we wanted to improve that, simplifying the way the managed service partner could see all his customers environments at once - the Partner View was born. A **multi-tenancy VMware portal** to remotely look over the customers shoulder, supporting him in the best possible way to run the perfect VMware.

About a week ago, when a VMware reseller sent us an email, we noticed that we need to promote the Partner View again. An excerpt of that email:

> Here is the question.  If I install one instance of Opvizor for each of the customers above (6 instances), how will that data come across when viewing from the Opvizor web site.  I was dreaming last night that it might be some rudimentary form of single pane of glass (SPOG) viewing.  Or perhaps a set of links/tabs across the top of the dashboard - one for each program.  Once the tab is clicked, you would see a normal Opvizor dashboard for that program, but all the data is readily available without having to open up 6-7 instances of Opvizor.

Dear Partner, thanks for your email - and we´re more than glad to tell you and all others that are interested: **It´s already in the product, we can easily enable it for you!**

The customer just needs to add your "partner" type account and you can directly view it within the Partner View, Multi-Tenancy VMware Portal.

When double-clicking the headline of the widget, your browser automatically opens another tab with the customers environment. There is no need of logging in again. And the customer still has total control to allow or deny the access!
