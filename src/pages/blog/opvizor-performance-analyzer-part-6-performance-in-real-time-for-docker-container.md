[Here](http://docs.projectatomic.io/container-best-practices/) are best practices for Docker container:

"The documentation has been written specifically for the developers who are writing Dockerfiles to create images. Dockerfiles can become rather complex depending on the application being containerized so we are passing on our experience with Dockerfiles through a series of best practices.

This guide of best practices is not a reference guide of all the Dockerfile instructions. There is plenty of documentation available on the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/) should you require that sort of content."

Mike Coleman said [here](https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/swarmweek-docker-swarm-exceeds-kubernetes-scale/):

"When you think about which orchestration tool is right for your environment, we believe the following three key things must be considered:

- Performance: How fast can I get containers up and running at scale? How responsive is the system when under load?
- Simplicity: What’s the learning curve to set up and ongoing burden to maintain? How many moving parts are there?
- Flexibility: Does it integrate with my current environment and workflows? Will my applications seamlessly move from dev to test to production? Will I be locked into a specific platform?"

## The New Way

If you're looking for a very modern way to check and monitor performance, you should give [Performance Analyzer a try](http://try.opvizor.com/perfanalyzer/). 

Monitor and Analyze Docker container configuration and performance metrics. Correlate events and metrics from applications, OS and container combining our Linux, Windows and Docker metrics. Troubleshoot issues using our efficient data crawler and preconfigured dashboards.

Some of our Docker integration features are:

- Get System overall status (across multiple systems)
- Check Container performance and utilization
- Full insights into Disk Latency and VM Disk IOps
- See Memory Issues and Network Issues (Packet Loss) instantly
- Get all networking details
- Combine with applications running inside the container
