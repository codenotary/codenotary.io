# Microsoft Windows 7 virtual machines running on ESXi 6.0 hosts restart unexpectedly

There has been a new bug reported by VMware that is currently unsolved and causes MS Windows 7 VMs to restart without any warning on an ESXi 6.0 host.

If you can find entries like the following within the vmkwarning.log files then you're affected.

## Workaround

It seems that the crash is caused by high resolution settings or multiple monitor support. Therefore the workaround is to either reduce the display resolution and limit the VM to one monitor.
