VMware vExpert Michael White played with our very advanced anonymization and answered some of the typical questions in his blog.

"For example, you can in Top 5 Largest datastores things like ^^324^^. I was curious about that. It turns out that I was looking at Opvizor through the Internet. If I had looked at it via the VM I had installed the Opvizor software on I would not see anonymized information like that but rather the proper names. Very good to know. If however you want to look at it via the Internet, and see real names you can can choose to NOT anonymize. Use the desktop icon to start Opvizor and make the change."

Thanks Michael for blogging about our **anonymization**. [Read the complete article here](http://notesfrommwhite.net/2015/02/17/wonder-why-you-see-494-instead-of-real-names/)
