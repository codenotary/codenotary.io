Santiago Comella-Dorda, Chandra Gnanasambandam, and Bhavik Shah from [McKinsey](http://www.twitter.com/mckinsey "McKinsey ") published an article about the adoption and the benefits of cloud computing.Â 

They don't stop with the common marketing phrases about cloud computing for end customers, they especially cover the aspects from a development perspective as well.

We couldn't agree more to the article content and want to share that great article with you:
