Keeping your VMware system safe from intruders is an absolute priority just as it is with a physical system. By reducing access and applying security patches, administrators keep the system more like Fort Knox than Fannie Mae. VMware searches for security issues and provides alerts to customers when problems are found. Making sure that your virtual system is consistently protected from a variety of security issues that potentially could leave your system helpless, costing you customer loyalty and money is important. Learning how to control all aspects of your VMware environment is essential.

## Traditional Anti-Virus Software May Be Inadequate

Traditional anti-virus programs may be inefficient in today's virtual world. Leaving businesses open to a data breach is a serious concern. Sensitive information can be harvested and used for nefarious purposes. [Vigilance](http://www.vmware.com/security "Vigilance ") is a needed behavior when admins seek to keep data safe, yet the immensity of the problem keeps many admins up at night. Maintaining a health check on VMware systems is a function of Opvizor's service. Keeping a lookout for alerts that might concern your safety keeps your business on top of potential security leaks.

## Virtualization Networking Issues

As businesses embrace virtualization, security issues evolve. This vast networking environment means admins need a way to stay on top of potential threats. Data breaches often involve malware that is not new, but well-known. In addition, threats to your company's data are more sophisticated, and managing them inadequately may leave a business open to risk. Using Opvizor's alert notification system helps alleviate that risk.

## Management of Virtual Security Agents

Managing VMware environment with security agents is one way to alleviate the burden of needing advanced and complex security. Being able to adapt as VMs change their systemic environment can be daunting. Managing this with a system that checks the needs of your virtual system on a daily basis and provides automated solutions is a way to accomplish this. Opvizor gives admins peace of mind knowing that someone is watching the store.

## Treating VMs Like Physical Machines

From a security standpoint, this means taking the same [precautions](http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/display/istcontrib/VMware+Security+Recommendations+and+Best+Practices "precautions") one would take with a physical machine. Realizing that VMs are exposed to the same threats as physical machines helps set a secure mindset. From backing up data to updating your virtual system, maintaining the overall health of the system is important. The use of automatic updates is an efficient way of doing this. Opvizor's health check lets you know about vulnerabilities and threat-weak areas.

## Ways to Enhance Security on Virtual Machines

As with a physical machine, setting up anti-virus programs on [virtual machines](http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/tip/Antivirus-scans-How-to-improve-performance-in-virtual-environments "virtual machines") maintains safety. Selecting passwords that are strong and changing them on an ongoing basis is another way of preventing access to your system. It is also important to assure that others on your virtual system such as guests have the same amount of security as you have. A weak link can allow threats to enter. Limiting guest access helps. Taking care with snapshots is another way to promote security.

Using Opvizor as a frontline automated online system to keep your VMware safe and functioning properly helps prevent malicious intrusion into your system. Choosing to guard data in a Fort Knox kind of way maintains your system with an eye toward the damage threat risks can impose. Letting Opvizor keep a health watch of your virtual environment on a daily basis helps your company address security issues.Â
