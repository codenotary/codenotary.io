Let's play marketing scrabble! Today every service offering needs to have a corresponding name - so we offer SaaS, HaaS and RaaS. You know Software-as-a-Service of course but what's about Healthcheck-as-a-Service or Reports-as-a-Service? Why not?

But what means our **VMware Healthcheck** Service to you, I don't want you to be left alone with the 'stupid' word game:

- Analyzes your infrastructure against the most comprehensive rule-base in the industry (730+ rules and counting, so we gave up on updating)
- Provides detailed, validates solutions for each issue
- Analyzes performance bottlenecks, resource constraints and broken snapshots
- Provides advice on how to meet best practices
- No administrative burden on updates or providing huge local resources

The best thing is, that we work with YOU - we receive daily new issue rules from customers, consultants and from vendors. These mostly harmful situation will be detected automatically as we integrate the new rules in a fast and tested way.
