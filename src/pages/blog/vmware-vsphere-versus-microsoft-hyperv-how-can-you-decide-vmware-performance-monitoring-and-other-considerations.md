Are you a Hyper-V user looking to make an entrance into the world of VMware vSphere? Perhaps you're a VMware administrator trying to take on some Hyper-V? Whatever the situation, you'll need to know the differences between, the similarities between, and the capabilities of each platform. Here is your guide. 

## The Size of Your Organization is No Longer a Determining Factor

\[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="585"\]![VMware performance](/images/blog/bigstock-Small-business--owner-of-a-co-15610985.jpg) vSphere is now just as at home in the small mom and pop shop as it is in the large worldwide organization with thousands of employees and machines. However, it hasn't lost its capabilities in terms of managing a large fleet of virtual machines.\[/caption\]Once upon a time, Microsoft developed and marketed Hyper-V to the small business, while vSphere was primarily designed and sold to the enterprise and other large organizations. This is [no longer the case](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2614229/virtualization/virtualization-showdown--microsoft-hyper-v-2012-vs--vmware-vsphere-5-1.html). Hyper-V is now easily scalable for larger organizations, while vSphere is just as comfortable in the small biz as it is in the sprawling corporation. 

## vSphere is Lighter Weight for the Capabilities it Offers 

One area where vSphere clearly surpasses Hyper-V is that, like many of Microsoft's products, Hyper-V carries a large footprint, whereas [vSphere is lightweight](https://redmondmag.com/articles/2015/05/01/vsphere-vs-hyperv.aspx). While both systems offer impressively high availability (which is always the goal of virtualization) the latest version of vSphere packs a healthy punch for its weight class. 

vSphere also offers some features that aren't yet offered in Hyper-V. 

VMware vSphere is scalable up to 64 hosts per cluster, which is twice what it used to be at 32 hosts per cluster. A vSphere cluster is able to handle [as many as 8,000 virtual machines](http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/VMware-vs-Hyper-V-storage-comparison), which is twice the number it used to be capable of. A single vSphere host can manage as many as 1,000 virtual machines, and each host is able to support as many as 480 physical CPUs and 12 TB of RAM. Comparatively, Hyper-V is able to support 320 logical processors and just 4 TB or RAM. A single Hyper-V server is capable of hosting 1,024 virtual machines. 

## vSphere Now Offers Excellent Security Capabilities

\[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="585"\]![VMware performance](/images/blog/bigstock-Computer-Security-Breach-83131844.jpg) In response to a greater number of online threats that affect virtual environments, vSphere has improved their security features and functionality.\[/caption\]The [latest version of vSphere](http://blogs.technet.com/b/keithmayer/archive/2013/09/24/vmware-or-microsoft-comparing-vsphere-5-5-and-windows-server-2012-r2-at-a-glance.aspx) also allows you to manage password complexity rules for a host within the cluster, and to manage the number of login attempts allowed when an incorrect password is entered. Hyper-V still manages these and other security issues within Active Directory. 

VMware also upped their game in terms of the new guest operating systems that it provides official support for. The latest operating systems include:

- Oracle Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 3 Quarterly Update 3
- Asianux 4 SP4
- Solaris 11.2
- Ubuntu 12.04.5
- Ubuntu 14.04.1
- Oracle Linux 7
- FreeBSD 9.3
- Mac OS X 10.10

With VMware performance monitoring tools like Opvizor, managing the VMware environment has never been easier.
