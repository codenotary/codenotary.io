If you happen to be in (or are looking for a reason to be in) the region of Denmark near the holidays, VMware will be hosting the Nordic VMUG UserCon on December 1, 2015 at the Scandic Copenhagen Hotel. While this is a small conference, they've managed to pull together a pretty impressive little list of speakers and topics to cover.

This event will be an excellent opportunity for people in the virtualization and cloud computing world to get a feel of what the larger VMworld conference has to offer. This event will be a bit smaller than VMworld, but VMware is packing it full of interesting and knowledgeable speakers. There will also be a lot of opportunities for attendees to see many of the wonderful products that are available in VMware performance monitoring.

## Speakers and Topics at Nordic VMUG

In case you can't make it to VMworld, VMware holds multiple smaller events during the year. Many of the same popular keynote speakers that make VMworld so popular also speak at the smaller events like VMUG.

Among the speakers at this event will be [Duncan Epping](https://twitter.com/DuncanYB "Duncan Epping"). He is a Chief Technologist at VMware and the author of several books. He writes for the virtualization blog [yellow-bricks.com](http://www.yellow-bricks.com "yellow-bricks.com"). At this year's event he will talk about the present state of Virtual SAN and what is coming up in the near future.

[Paudie O´Rourdian](https://twitter.com/oriorp "Paudie O´Rourdian") knows a lot about VMware support and has spoken in Denmark twice before. His portion of the event is always popular. This year he will be discussing how to configure and install Virtual SAN Stretch Cluster. 

[William Lam](https://twitter.com/lamw "William Lam")'s field of expertise is automation, integration, and datacenter operation. He has spoken at VMworld several times. His talks always manage to draw the crowds and can be a tough ticket to come by. This will be his first time at UserCon. He will be talking about how non-developers can use and navigate the vSphere API.

## Welcome Some Familiar Speakers from VMworld

Virtualization networks and [Cormac Hogan](https://twitter.com/CormacJHogan "Cormac Hogan") are two names that just seem to go together. Cormac is also well known in many other aspects of VMware's business, earning him the nickname Mr. VMware Storage. His portions of this event tend to be heavily attended and always generate a buzz. This year he will be speaking about the recent enhancements to the core vSphere storage technologies.

[Joerg Lew](https://twitter.com/joerglew "Joerg Lew")'s speeches are some of the high points at VMworld. His knowledge of orchestration and automation is always welcome at any VMware event. He will be giving a "getting started" seminar that will include the key concepts in understanding vRO.

One of the keynote speakers will be [Paul Strong](https://twitter.com/pauldstrong "Paul Strong"), VMware Chief Technology Officer, and many people are looking forward to the years of knowledge that he has to offer. The other keynote speaker will be one of the most anticipated guests, [Andreas Mogensen](https://twitter.com/Astro_Andreas "Andreas Mogensen"). He is a hometown hero in that he was the first Danish-born astronaut to go to the International Space Station.

## Other Vendors Will be Represented, Too

In addition to these guest speakers, there will be presentations from companies like [Zerto](http://www.zerto.com "Zerto"). They are a leading name in disaster recovery when it comes to the virtualized infrastructure. They will have representatives speaking about the difference between backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity.

There will be a lot of opportunities to see the products being showcased by partners of VMware. In addition, UserCon is a great place to meet and discuss your own business and ideas with people from other Nordic countries. The Nordic VMware UserCon will be a great way to get a feel of all of the things that VMware has to offer.
