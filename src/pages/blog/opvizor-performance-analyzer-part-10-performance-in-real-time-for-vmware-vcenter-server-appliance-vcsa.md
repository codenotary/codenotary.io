There is a white paper available from VMware. You can download the complete file [here](http://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/techpaper/vmware-vcenter6-performance-white-paper.pdf).

### On [Derek Seaman](https://twitter.com/vdereks)'s [Blog](http://www.derekseaman.com/author/derek858) you can find a few sessions regarding vCenter Performance, e.g.:

> Session: INF8108
> 
> Teaser: 5.5 to 6.0 is 300% faster for vCenter operations From 6.0 to 6.5(?) is another 100% higher.
> 
> HTML5 vs. Flex client: Shows a chart with dramatically faster HtML5 performance over Flash client.
> 
> VCSA vs. windows – When you have a datacenter with heavy load the VCSA far out performs Windows vCenter.

A short overview from [OpManagers](https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/) VMware Monitoring:

Troubleshooting

**Best-in-class VMware monitoring using over 70 VMware performance monitors**

OpManager’s VMware Monitor provides indepth, agentless monitoring of VMware-virtualized servers to give IT administrators a single fault and performance management console for entire server infrastructure - both physical and virtual. In addition to SNMP and WMI-based monitoring, OpManager leverages VMware APIs to help you:
