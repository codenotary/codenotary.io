									It makes for a great one-stop shop for monitoring key VMware metrics! I have been using CodeNotary CNIL Metrics and Logs for about a year. Setup and operational in less than 30 minutes. It comes pre-packaged with ready to use dashboards that are color coded with thresholds providing immediate feedback on performance, KPIs, health and areas of concerns. The team is skilled in this area and knows what their customer base is seeking. Overall, Iâ€™m very pleased with the application and the support team behind it. Highly recommended!

									While looking for a suitable monitoring, analysis and troubleshooting product for our VMware vSphere infrastructure, we found Performance Analyzer. We were impressed by the flexibility and ease of deployment of the virtual appliance and the nearly instant time to value.

									Performance Analyzer was running in 25 minutes. CodeNotary CNIL Metrics and Logs has provided us with insights into our VMware cluster performance that we have never previously had and immediately alerted us to several issues we were unaware of.
